@article{Bigsten2003,
abstract = {The paper investigates the impact of growth on poverty in Ethiopia by analysing panel data covering 1994–97, a period of economic recovery driven by peace, good weather, and much improved macroeconomic management. The analysis of poverty shows land ownership, education, type of crops planted, occupations in urban areas, dependency ratios, and location to be important determinants. The characteristics of households that fell into or escaped from poverty are examined; in addition, the profile of those that remained poor during the period (the “chronic” poor) is looked at. In rural areas, the cultivation of a nontraditional export crop (chat) has significantly improved the welfare of households. Primary education plays a more important role in improving welfare in urban than in rural areas. Decomposition of changes in poverty into growth and redistribution components indicates that potential poverty reduction due to the increase in real per capita income was to some extent counteracted by worsening income distribution. The implications of the results for a propoor policy are discussed.},

@article{Moenius2006,
abstract = {In this paper, we derive and compare several production- and export-based measures of comparative advantage within a Ricardian framework. We first sort commodities into industries in order to obtain industry-specific indicators of comparative advantage. We then compare these measures against a simple theoretical benchmark. First, we show that theoretically correct production- and export-based indicators are equivalent when there are no trade costs such as transport fees, insurance and tariffs. However, in the presence of trade costs, most measures perform poorly, and the more important trade costs are, generally the poorer the performance. Second, Balassa's (1965, 1979) export-based index of Revealed Comparative Advantage is generally not a valid measure of comparative advantage across industries or over time. It is only a valid measure within an industry for a given period. However, we derive structural estimation equations for how it can be appropriately used for regression analysis of comparative advantage. Finally, we suggest how export-based measures may be decomposed into two components, one measuring relative technology in production and the other measuring relative trade costs, improving the performance of measures when trade costs are present. These allow us to study factors that influence comparative advantage and costs of trade at the same time.},

abstract = {The study has three main findings. First, when compared to what they would have spent without the receipt of remittances, households receiving remittances spend less at the margin on one key consumption good: food. Second, households receiving remittances spend more at the margin on three important investment goods: education, housing, and health. Third, the receipt of remittances greatly reduces the likelihood of household poverty. These findings support the growing view that remittances can reduce poverty and increase human and physical capital investment in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of internal remittances (from Ghana) and international remittances (from African or other countries) on investment and poverty in Ghana. It has three findings. First, when compared to what they would have spent without the receipt of remittances, households receiving remittances spend less at the margin on food.

abstract = {Techniques such as multiplier analysis and Input-Output analysis are still very commonly used to make estimates of the economic impact of changes in tourism expenditure. These techniques have serious limitations, and as a result, alternative techniques have been developed to address the problems. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are now extensively used, especially in Australia, the UK, the US and Canada, to estimate economic impacts of a wide variety of changes and policies, across most sectors. CGE techniques have been used in the tourism context, but so far, not extensively. Economic evaluation in tourism thus fails to achieve best practice. The paper presents arguments in support of CGE modelling as the preferred technique in analysing the economic impacts of tourism, and discusses its potential to drive future research in this area that is more relevant to real world tourism destinations.},

Some quantitative estimates of the relative impact of individual factors on remittances are also obtained. Some hints are also given for a changing remitting behaviour of Greek migrants in Germany, along with the changing character of migration in that country.},

abstract = {In response to income fluctuations, households smooth consumption by substituting between market expenditure and time inputs. This paper provides evidence of this substitution in the context of food consumption over transitory and permanent income fluctuations in Mexico. Household time investments drive a wedge between consumption and expenditure, amplifying measured expenditure volatility. Volatility decompositions for Mexico and the United States suggest that the extent of bias in expenditure-based measures induced by changes in marketization is relatively larger in the Mexican setting. These findings imply that volatility comparisons between commodities or across countries are misleading when consumption measures ignore home production. (JEL D12, D91, E21, E32, O11, O12)},

According to the analysis results, initial trust beliefs were significantly influenced by initial trust bases such as company reputation, structural assurance, and trusting stance, and initial trust beliefs indirectly influenced the first purchase intention through consumer attitude. In TAM constructs, only perceived usefulness directly influenced the usage attitude of online shopping systems, then indirectly influenced the first purchase intention. These results imply that online consumers consider perceived ease of use as a basic requirement for system design. It was also found that there is a time cushion between the time of first purchase and the time of belief formation. On the whole, these results reinforced the theory that a relationship between belief (trust and perceived usefulness) and intention was better explained when it was mediated by attitude.},

abstract = {Village economies and peasant households represent the main link between the economy and the environment in sub-Saharan Africa. The links from the macro level and down to the household level and further to the natural resource base are complex. It may therefore be difficult to predict the impact of macro policies and external shocks on the environment. This paper presents a typology of village economies and village economy-wide models. The framework is applied to a special case where a model is proposed and estimated to examine the impacts of external shocks, including structural adjustment policies, on cash-crop production and chitemene (shifting cultivation) in a remote Zambian village characterized by a missing (or negligible) labour market, input supply constraints, and credit rationing. Our findings indicate that structural adjustment policies, by decreasing the profitability of maize production, may encourage households to increase their chitemene production, resulting in more rapid deforestation.},

Technological change holds the potential to increase crop output as well as incomes of farmers and the communities in which they live. We carry out a local economy-wide impact evaluation of productivity-enhancing technological change amongst small-scale cotton producers in Tanzania's Lake Zone. Our analysis reveals that demand constraints shift benefits from farmers to downstream processors, while limiting positive spillovers within local economies. Excess cotton gin capacity does the opposite. Interventions to ensure markets for increased output should complement strategies to raise productivity if a project's goal is to improve welfare in farm households and the communities in which they live.},

The Yambassa region, where the tropical forest and savannah meet, is characterized by a situation of land abundance and the presence of man-made forest thickets. Our work is based on a thorough study of the land and agro-economic situations in the zone. Three research orientations are privileged: i) the roles played by the origins of the forest vegetation which developed around the first dwellings in the savannah and determined the original emergence and evolving schemes of ownership rights to these sectors of land; ii) evolution of the agricultural dynamics characterized by the new stakes associated with appropriation of the unoccupied savannah land in response to the technical and economic evolution of the agricultural production system; and iii) the emergence of a land market for the savannah although this land remains subject to still moderate land pressure compared to that affecting forest land.},

This implementation of the largest social pension program in the world offers a unique setting for studying the economics of intergenerational relationships during development, given the rapidity of China's population aging, traditions of filial piety and co-residence, decreasing number of children, and dearth of formal social security, at a relatively low income level. We draw on rich household surveys from two provinces at distinct development stages - impoverished Guizhou and relatively well-off Shandong - to better understand heterogeneity in the impact of pension benefits. Employing a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, we find that around the pension eligibility age cut-off, the NRPS significantly reduces intergenerational co-residence, especially between elderly parents and their adults sons; promotes pensioners' healthcare service consumption; and weakens (but does not supplant) non-pecuniary and pecuniary transfers across three generations. These effects are much larger in less developed Guizhou province.},

abstract = {Background Our 2001 study in 5 states found that medical problems contributed to at least 46.2{\%} of all bankruptcies. Since then, health costs and the numbers of un- and underinsured have increased, and bankruptcy laws have tightened. Methods We surveyed a random national sample of 2314 bankruptcy filers in 2007, abstracted their court records, and interviewed 1032 of them. We designated bankruptcies as “medical” based on debtors' stated reasons for filing, income loss due to illness, and the magnitude of their medical debts. Results Using a conservative definition, 62.1{\%} of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical; 92{\%} of these medical debtors had medical debts over {\$}5000, or 10{\%} of pretax family income. The rest met criteria for medical bankruptcy because they had lost significant income due to illness or mortgaged a home to pay medical bills. Most medical debtors were well educated, owned homes, and had middle-class occupations. Three quarters had health insurance. Using identical definitions in 2001 and 2007, the share of bankruptcies attributable to medical problems rose by 49.6{\%}. In logistic regression analysis controlling for demographic factors, the odds that a bankruptcy had a medical cause was 2.38-fold higher in 2007 than in 2001. Conclusions Illness and medical bills contribute to a large and increasing share of US bankruptcies.},

Our analysis indicates that, in China, rice yields have converged over time and rice production has become increasingly homogeneous. In contrast, rice yields in Brazil have diverged over time, primarily due to variations in upland rice yields. Three hypothetical explanations may account for the different behaviors of rice yields in Brazil and China, namely: 1) differences in production systems (i.e. irrigated in China vs. upland in Brazil); 2) changes in rainfall patterns; and 3) bias in agricultural research and development (R{\&}D) towards irrigated rice. Our empirical analysis supports the first two hypotheses by establishing that: 1) upland rice shows much more variation in yields compared to irrigated rice; and 2) changing rainfall patterns have primarily affected upland rice. We also provide evidence of the bias towards irrigated systems by looking at the patterns of varietal release. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc..},

There are several hypotheses in this area: The scale hypothesis says that production is scaled up and in turn, pollution increases. The technique hypothesis says that production methods become cleaner and pollution decreases. The composition hypothesis says that composition of industries changes and pollution reflects the new composition. We analyse the relative strength of the hypotheses by means of an environmental CGE-model, and in the case of air pollution find support for a composition effect in favour of clean industries. Thanks to the composition effect, emissions to air of greenhouse gases fall. Emissions of particles and SO2 also fall, but emissions of NOx and VOC rise. Since particle and SO2-emissions fall we estimate that public health improves.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the recent literature on trade liberalisation and economic growth. While there are serious methodological challenges and disagreements about the strength of the evidence, the most plausible conclusion is that liberalisation generally induces a temporary (but possibly long-lived) increase in growth. A major component of this is an increase in productivity. Part 2 stresses the importance of other factors in achieving growth, such as other policies, investment and institutions, but argues that many of these respond positively to trade liberalisation. It also considers the implementation of liberalisation and notes the benefits of simple and transparent trade regimes.},

@article{Deaton1991,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of saving behavior. When consumers are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes. As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained by traditional life-cycle models.},

It has usually been addressed by estimating the graphon, a function that determines the matrix of edge probabilities, but is ill-defined without strong assumptions on the network structure. Here we propose a novel computationally efficient method based on neighborhood smoothing to estimate the expectation of the adjacency matrix directly, without making the strong structural assumptions graphon estimation requires. The neighborhood smoothing method requires little tuning, has a competitive mean-squared error rate, and outperforms many benchmark methods on the task of link prediction in both simulated and real networks.},

Part one of the paper surveys recent literature on the labor-market consequences of Mexico's economic reforms in the 1980?s. Mexico's policy reforms appear to have raised the demand for skill in the country, reduced rents in industries that prior to reform paid their workers high wages, and raised the premium paid to workers in states along the U.S. border. These changes have resulted in an increase in wage dispersion in the country. Part two of the paper examines changes in Mexico's wage structure during the 1990's. In the last decade, Mexico has experienced rising returns to skill, which mirror closely wage movements in the United States. There is, however, little evidence of wage convergence between the two countries. Regional wage differentials in Mexico have widened and appear to be explained largely by variation in regional access to foreign trade and investment and in regional opportunities for migration to the United States. I discuss implications of Mexico's experience for the rest of Latin America in the event a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas is enacted.},

At about 30 percent of the labor force, Moldova's emigrant population is in relative terms among the largest in the world. This study uses a unique household survey to examine the impact of emigration on wages in Moldova. The authors find a positive and significant impact of emigration on wages and the result is robust to the use of alternative samples and specifications. The size of the emigration coefficient varies depending on the sample and model specification, but the baseline result suggests that, on average, a 10 percent increase in the emigration rate is associated with 3.2 percent increase in wages. At the same time, there is evidence of significant differences across economic sectors in the estimated effect of emigration on wages. The authors speculate and provide some evidence that offsetting changes in labor demand, as revealed by information on employment growth by sector, may help explain some of the heterogeneity. This},

A wide range of farmers, representatives of cooperatives and export companies in Nicaragua were interviewed during seven months of field work between 2005 and 2008. Fair Trade organic production raises farmer income when low-intensity organic farming is an alternative to low-intensity conventional farming. However, low-intensity farming produces very little coffee in the case of the most marginalized farmers, keeping these farmers in poverty. With higher intensities of management, the economic advantages of Fair Trade organic production largely depend on prices in the mainstream market.},

abstract = {Summary There has been much debate about how much poor people in developing countries gain from trade openness, as one aspect of "globalization." The paper views the issue through both "macro" and "micro" empirical lenses. The macro lens uses cross-country comparisons and aggregate time series data; the micro lens uses household-level data combined with structural modeling of the impacts of specific trade reforms. Case studies are presented for China and Morocco. Both the macro and micro approaches cast doubt on some widely heard generalizations from both sides of the globalization debate. Additionally, the micro lens indicates considerable heterogeneity in the welfare impacts of trade reforms, with both gainers and losers among the poor. A number of covariates of the individual gains are identified. The results point to the importance of combining trade reforms with well-designed social protection policies.},

Often the instrument exclusion restriction that underlies the validity of the usual IV inference is suspect; that is, instruments are only plausibly exogenous. We present practical methods for performing inference while relaxing the exclusion restriction. We illustrate the approaches with empirical examples that examine the effect of 401(k) participation on asset accumulation, price elasticity of demand for margarine, and returns to schooling. We find that inference is informative even with a substantial relaxation of the exclusion restriction in two of the three cases.},

While for the emerging economies, it could be small holder inclusion in agricultural commercialization and/or reducing rural-urban income gaps. Food sectors in developing countries are witnessing profound changes driven by: rapid income growth; urbanization; global inter-connectedness; technology access; and climate change.

abstract = {The EU Single Farm Payment (SFP) is currently distributed in proportion to primary factor shares in version 8 of the GTAP database. In this paper, we investigate whether this way of modeling the EU SFP makes a difference in analyzing agricultural policy reforms. To do so, we create alternative versions of the GTAP database to compare the effects with the default setting in GTAP. Employing OECD data, along with the GTAP framework, we vary the assumptions about the allocation of the SFP. In the process, we demonstrate how to alter and update the GTAP database to implement domestic support of OECD PSE tables. We provide a detailed overview supplemented with assumptions of payment allocation, shock calculations and in particular, the Altertax procedure to update value flows and price equations extended in the GTAP model. Subsequently, we illustrate the impact of those assumptions by simulating a 100{\%} removal of the SFP using the deviating versions of GTAP database. This sensitivity analysis reveals strong differences in results, but particularly in production responses of food and agricultural sectors that decrease with an increasing degree of decoupling. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the effect on welfare and the trade balance decreases with an increasing degree of decoupling. This experiment shows that the allocation of the SFP can have strong impacts on simulation results.},

The paper proposes and examines twin hypotheses that higher-income consumers may be more interested in saving time, while lower-income consumers may be more interested in saving money. The results show that higher-income consumers exhibit a greater tendency toward saving time than lower-income consumers, while the relationship between income level and saving money is less certain. The findings have important implications for marketing managers and public policy makers. Marketing managers need to be aware of the relative importance of saving time versus saving money to online shoppers while selecting the product assortment to be made available online. Public policy makers want to educate lower-income consumers on the importance of having saving money as an important shopping goal. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This article investigates the issue empirically by surveying 148 households randomly selected in five coastal communities of the Philippines. There is overwhelming evidence that aquaculture benefits the poor in important ways and that it is perceived very positively by poor and non-poor alike. In particular, the poor derive a relatively larger share of their income from it than the rich, and a lowering of the poverty line only reinforces this result. A Gini decomposition exercise also shows unambiguously that aquaculture represents an inequality-reducing source of income, providing employment to a large number of unskilled workers in communities characterised by large labour surpluses.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of horizontal equity in health care utilization in 10 European countries and the US. It does not only extend previous work by using more recent data from a larger set of countries, but also uses new methods and presents disaggregated results by various types of care. In all countries, the lower-income groups are more intensive users of the health care system. But after indirect standardization for need differences, there is little or no evidence of significant inequity in the delivery of health care overall, though in half of the countries, significant pro-rich inequity emerges for physician contacts. This seems to be due mainly to a higher use of medical specialist services by higher-income groups and a higher use of GP care among lower-income groups. These findings appear to be fairly general and emerge in countries with very diverse characteristics regarding access and provider incentives.},

abstract = {Food safety is the most vital component of food security. One option to ensure food safety is through enhancing compliance at the farm level. This study investigates the status, estimates the cost, identifies the determinants, and assesses the impact of compliance with food safety measures in milk production in Nepal. The study is based on cross-section primary data collected at the farm level from six districts of Nepal. These districts are known for milk production and capture the geographical and institutional diversity of milk production in the country. The study shows that the status of compliance with food safety measures at the dairy farm level is not very encouraging. The intensity with which food safety practices are adopted shows wide inter- and intra-district variations. This intensity depicts a positive relationship to herd size. The additional cost of compliance with food milk safety measures reveals an inverse relationship with herd size. The factors associated with the adoption of food safety measures are caste, number of children and elderly people in a family, household labor size, herd size, access to information, inspection for conformity with the safety and quality standards in dairy farming, perception of households about food safety assistance provided by milk buyers, and market outlet types. We also provide evidence of the impact of food safety measures on farm-gate prices and farmers' profitability.},

With survey data on family health and nutrition in Brazil, the equality of parental income effects is rejected. Unearned income in the hands of a mother has a bigger effect on her family's health than income under the control of a father; for child survival probabilities the effect is almost twenty times bigger. The common preference (or neoclassical) model of the household is rejected. If unearned income is measured with error and income is pooled then the ratio of maternal to paternal income effects should be the same; equality of the ratios cannot be rejected. There is also evidence for gender preference: mothers prefer to devote resources to improving the nutritional status of their daughters, fathers to sons.},

@article{Andrews2011,
abstract = {Together with reductions in indirect taxes on food imports, cash for work programs were one of the main responses implemented by African governments following the food, fuel, and financial crisis of recent years. The main objective of those programs was to help the poor cope with the various shocks by increasing their net earnings through community-level work paid for under the programs. Yet it is unclear whether these cash for work programs indeed reached their intended beneficiaries and to what degree they generated other, potentially long-term beneficial impacts. This paper explores these issues in the context of Liberia and the performance of the Cash for Work Temporary Employment Program (CfWTEP) funded by the World Bank through an emergency crisis facility in response to the 2007/2008 food crisis. Both quantitative and qualitative data are presented, focusing on the operational and policy experiences emerging from program implementation. This paper analyzes the context that led to the creation and implementation of the CfWTEP in Liberia, the nature and administrative arrangements for the program, and its operational performance. The objective is to share the lessons learned from evaluation findings so that they can be useful for implementing similar programs in the future in Liberia itself or in other countries. Findings from the analysis highlight the possibilities of implementing public works program in low capacity, post conflict setting and the scope for using the program as a springboard towards a broader and more comprehensive social safety net.},

@article{Lambrecht2016,
abstract = {Improving women's access to land is high on the agricultural policy agenda of both governmental and non-governmental agencies. Yet, the determinants and rationale of gendered access to land are not well understood. This paper argues that gender relations are more than the outcomes of negotiations within households. It explains the importance of social norms, perceptions, and formal and informal rules shaping access to land for male and female farmers at four levels: (1) the household/family, (2) the community, (3) the state, and (4) the market. The framework is applied to Ghana, using the results from qualitative field work. Norms on household and family organization and on men's and women's responsibilities and capabilities play a key role in gendered allocation of resources. However, these norms and perceptions are dynamic and evolve jointly with the development of markets and changes in values of inputs such as labor and land. Theoretical models that represent the gendered distribution of assets as the result of intrahousehold bargaining should be revised, and extrahousehold factors should be included. From a policy perspective, laws that ensure gender equality in terms of inheritance and a more gender-equitable distribution of property upon divorce can play a key role in improving women's property rights. Yet, their impact may be limited where customary rights dominate and social norms and rules continue to discriminate according to gender.},

On the analytical side, the paper discusses the proper formulation of a research question, the choice of the analytical tools, as well as the interpretation of the results in the presence of pervasive endogeneity in all decisions surrounding migration. Particular attention is given to the use of instrumental variables in migration research. On the policy side, the paper argues that the private nature of migration and remittances implies a need to carefully spell out the rationale for interventions. It also notices the lack of good migration data and proper evaluations of migration-related government policies. The paper focuses mainly on microeconomic evidence about international migration, but much of the discussion extends to other settings as well.},

Our method is easily implemented in statistical packages,$\backslash$nsuch as Stata and SAS, that already offer cluster-robust standard$\backslash$nerrors when there is one-way clustering. The method is demonstrated$\backslash$nby a Monte Carlo analysis for a two-way random effects model; a Monte$\backslash$nCarlo analysis of a placebo law that extends the state-year effects$\backslash$nexample of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) to two dimensions;$\backslash$nand by application to studies in the empirical literature where two-way$\backslash$nclustering is present.},

abstract = {We implemented a randomized field experiment in Malawi examining borrower responses to being fingerprinted when applying for loans. This intervention improved the lender's ability to implement dynamic repayment incentives, allowing it to withhold future loans from past defaulters while rewarding good borrowers with better loan terms. As predicted by a simple model, fingerprinting led to substantially higher repayment rates for borrowers with the highest ex ante default risk, but had no effect for the rest of the borrowers. We provide unique evidence that this improvement in repayment rates is accompanied by behaviors consistent with less adverse selection and lower moral hazard. (JEL D14, D82, G21, O12, O16)},

abstract = {Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation (DD) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its " effect " as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an " effect " significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investi-gate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a " pre " -and " post " -period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

We find that aid inflows have systematic adverse effects on a country's competitiveness, as reflected in the lower relative growth rate of exportable industries. We provide some evidence suggesting that the channel for these effects is the real exchange rate appreciation caused by aid inflows. We conjecture that this may explain, in part, why it is hard to find robust evidence that foreign aid helps countries grow.},

If a master plan serves as guidance for urban polices that reduce property loss from earthquakes, floods, landslides, land subsidence, and rises in sea level, it will substantially limit urban development in areas at risk from environmental hazards. An environmental risk map weighted toward valuable forms of land cover was generated using geospatial databases of China's Yangtze River Delta region. Based on this data, the effects of five master plan measures—ring-road patterns, block size, the area of urban built-up lands, the locations of industrial sites, and preservation zoning—were tested using the multiple regression method. Cities showing a high degree of compliance, in particular with preservation zoning, had a smaller amount of urban land located in high-risk zones, on average, by 14km2. Among the top ten cities exposed to disproportionately high risks, eight were towns and only two were cities like Huzhou and Kunshan.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullain-athan (2004). Rejection rates of 10{\%} using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5{\%} using our methods.},

abstract = {METHODOLOGY: scientific method of " causes (conditions and shocks), behavior/mechanisms, effects " ; evidence base is review of survey and case study evidence ABSTRACT. Developing regions' food system has transformed rapidly in the past several decades. The food system is the dendritic cluster of R{\&}D value chains, and the value chains linking input suppliers to farmers, and farmers upstream to wholesalers and processors midstream, to retailers then consumers downstream. We analyze the transformation in terms of these value chains' structure and conduct, and the effects of changes in those on its performance in terms of impacts on consumers and farmers, as well as the efficiency of and waste in the overall chain. We highlight the role of, and implications for agricultural research, viewed broadly as farm technology as well as research pertaining to all aspects of input and output value chains. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers and Tom Tomich for very useful comments. This paper is part of a Special Issue: " Agricultural research for rural prosperity: Rethinking the pathways. " Reardon, Liverpool-Tasie, and Tschirley are grateful for funding from USAID via the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab at Michigan State University.},

Exploiting a unique nationally-representative household survey, we find evidence of large declines in the real value of per capita food consumption. Smaller price elasticities with respect to calories than with respect to food consumption suggest that households trade off quality for quantity as they move away from nutrient-rich foods such as meat and vegetables toward staple foods. Our work improves upon country-level simulation studies by providing estimates of actual household food security during a price shock in one of the world's poorest, most food-insecure countries.},

abstract = {This paper applies the production-theory approach to migration to assess the wage and employment effects of unskilled immigration to the United States. Native labour and foreign-born labour are disaggregated into four skill categories. Together with capital, this adds up to nine inputs. The data are cross section for 121 metropolitan areas. Both an aggregate cost function and a production function are estimated. The functional form that we use is the Symmetric Normalized Quadratic Semiflexible function. Special attention is devoted to required curvature conditions which have frequently been violated in previous work. Elasticity estimates are reported for alternative settings, including for the short run when we view domestic factor prices as given and the long run when we treat them as flexible. The results indicate that an increase of unskilled immigration has a small - but statistically significant - negative effect on low- and medium-skill native workers.},

Without relying on either increasing returns to scale or perfect substitutability between domestic and imported goods, the aggregate results are much stronger than in previous studies, especially if tariff reduction is restricted to intermediate goods only. The income distribution effects are regressive as the poorer classes do not consume imported goods or use them in production. However, after 9 or 10 years the trickle-down effect starts to take effect.},

The standard hedonic models are generalized to recognize the role of discounting of fuel efficiency and safety, yielding an estimated rate of time preference ranging from 11 to 17 percent. This range includes the prevailing rate of interest for car loans in 1988 and is consequently consistent with market rates. Purchasers exhibit an implicit value of life ranging from {\$}2.6 to {\$}3.7 million, which is within the range found in the labor market as well as other market contexts.

Recently, a new method has emerged for uncovering the factors driving regional growth disparities. The method involves historical analysis with a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This paper has three main aims. First, to demonstrate the capacity of the CGE historical technique to decompose the causes of regional divergence into clearly specified economic factors. Second, to provide a generic miniature model that can be used as a template for adapting any multi-regional CGE model to give it the capacity for undertaking historical analysis. Third, to demonstrate that this same miniature model can be used to explain the regional results in terms of the major model mechanisms behind them. Giesecke J. A. et Madden J. R.

A switching regression model developed in this paper explicitly links export adoption and land accumulation patterns controlling for pre-existing differentiation processes. Applied to survey data gathered from peasant households in Guatemala, the model provides evidence of equitable structural change induced by a recent export boom in vegetable crops. However, the optimism of these results is tempered by consideration of the unfavorable longer term market dynamics confronting small-scale producers.},

@article{So2001,
abstract = {Agriculture in limited resource areas is characterized by small farms which an generally too small to adequately support the needs of an average farm family. The farming operation can be described as a low input cropping system with the main energy source being manual labor, draught animals and in some areas hand tractors. These farming systems are the most important contributor to the national economy of many developing countries. The role of tillage is similar in dryland agricultural systems in both the high input (HICS) and low input cropping systems (LICS), however, wet cultivation or puddling is unique to lowland rice-based systems in low input cropping systems. Evidence suggest that tillage may result in marginal increases in crop yield in the short term, however, in the longer term it may be neutral or give rise to yield decreases associated with soil structural degradation. On marginal soils, tillage may be required to prepare suitable seedbeds or to release adequate Nitrogen through mineralization, but in the longer term, however, tillage reduces soil organic matter content, increases soil erodibility and the emission of greenhouse gases. Tillage in low input cropping systems involves a very large proportion of the population and any changes: in current practices such as increased mechanization will have a large social impact such as increased unemployment and increasing feminization of poverty, as mechanization may actually reduce jobs for women. Rapid mechanization is likely to result in failures, but slower change, accompanied by measures to provide alternative rural employment, might be beneficial. Agriculture in limited resource areas must produce the food and fiber needs of their community, and its future depends on the development of sustainable tillage/cropping systems that are suitable for the soil and climatic conditions. These should be based on sound biophysical principles and meet the needs of and he acceptable to the farming communities. Some of the principle requirements for a sustainable system includes the maintenance of soil health, an increase in the rain water use efficiency of the system, increased use of fertilizer and the prevention of erosion. The maintenance of crop residues on the surface is paramount for meeting these requirements, and the competing use of crop residues must be met from other sources. These requirements can be met within a zonal tillage system combined with suitable agroforestry, which will reduce the need for crop residues. It is, however, essential that farmers participate in the development of any new technologies to ensure adoption of the new system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Yet, interestingly, developing countries, and smaller economies, face much larger output declines following a disaster of similar relative magnitude than do developed countries or bigger economies. A close study of the determinants of these adverse macroeconomic output costs reveals several interesting patterns. Countries with a higher literacy rate, better institutions, higher per capita income, higher degree of openness to trade, and higher levels of government spending are better able to withstand the initial disaster shock and prevent further spillovers into the macro-economy. These all suggest an increased ability to mobilize resources for reconstruction. Financial conditions also seem to be of importance; countries with more foreign exchange reserves, and higher levels of domestic credit, but with less-open capital accounts appear more robust and better able to endure natural disasters, with less adverse spillover into domestic production.},

A total of 69 (59{\%}) victims met the criteria for acute PTSD, 19 of whom had a severe form. Although an inadequate degree of social support was more often noted in victims with severe PTSD, other demographic factors and degree of injury or property damage did not appear to be related to the presence of PTSD. Severity or presence of PTSD was supported by high scores on all HSCL subscale factors. These findings suggest a high incidence of acute PTSD in victims of natural disasters and the potential value of HSCL in screening for PTSD in large populations.},

abstract = {Immigrants may complement native workers, allow reallocation by skill in the firm and lower costs. These effects could be beneficial for the firm and increase its productivity and profits. However not all firmes use immigrants. Allowing firms to have differential fixed cost in hiring immigrants, because of different information and access to their network, we analyze the impact of an increase in local supply of immigrants on firms' immigrant employment and productivity. Using micro-level data on French firms during the period 1995-2005, we show that a supply-driven increase in foreign born workers in a department (location) increases the productivity of firms in that department. We also find that this effect is significantly stronger for firms with initially low (or zero) level of foreign employment. Those are also the firms whose share of immigrants increases the most. We also find that the positive productivity effect of immigrants is associated with faster growth of capital and improved export performances (for extensive and intensive margin) of the firms. While these outcomes depend on the firm share of immigrants in employment we find a positive effect of immigration on wages of natives and on specialization of natives in complex occupations that is common to all firms in the district. Supply-driven increase in foreign born workers in a department (location) implies a re-allocation of native workers towards communication and cognitive intensive tasks.},

The impact of across-the-board reductions in farm support on output, exports, employment, and land values will vary systematically across countries, depending on their relative reliance on export, output, and input subsidies. Furthermore, considerable maneuvering room exists, even after an aggregate reduction in support is agreed upon. For example, the aggregate U.S. producer subsidy equivalent could be reduced, while leaving unchanged the demand for farm labor, by shifting the mix of remaining subsidies toward inputs which are complementary with labor.},

abstract = {This article reviews how the process of corporatization transforms public sector management by adopting private sector principles. It argues that corporatization, as an institutional form emerging from a second wave of neoliberalism, threatens to undermine the democratic accountability of local authorities by virtue of restructuring the state in ways that are invisible to the public yet with highly negative outcomes for low-income communities. The article provides a case study on the water sector in Cape Town, South Africa by tracing the local authority's adoption of three cost-recovery policies and their impacts on low-income households over a five year period (1997-2001). Engineers are the key agents in the promotion of cost-recovery policies in the efforts to deliver services more [`]efficiently'. While these officials are highly skilled professionals in dealing with the technical side of the production process, they lack the social training necessary to deal with the politics of distribution. The prominence of the neoliberal agenda in urban management can be in part be attributed to the power of the technical over the political as engineers displace politicians in the deliberations over how to deliver services to poor areas of the city.},

abstract = {I document a significant deindustrialization trend in recent decades, that goes considerably beyond the advanced, post-industrial economies. The hump-shaped relationship between industrialization (measured by employment or output shares) and incomes has shifted downwards and moved closer to the origin. This means countries are running out of industrialization opportunities sooner and at much lower levels of income compared to the experience of early industrializers. Asian countries and manufactures exporters have been largely insulated from those trends, while Latin American countries have been especially hard hit. Advanced economies have lost considerable employment (especially of the low-skill type), but they have done surprisingly well in terms of manufacturing output shares at constant prices. While these trends are not very recent, the evidence suggests both globalization and labor-saving technological progress in manufacturing have been behind these developments. Premature deindustrialization has potentially significant economic and political ramifications, including lower economic growth and democratic failure.},

abstract = {This paper studies the response of poor rural households in rural Kenya to large temporary income changes. Using a randomized controlled trial, households were randomly assigned to receive unconditional cash transfers of at least USD 404 from the NGO GiveDirectly. We designed the experiment to address several long-standing questions in the economics literature: what is the shape of households' Engel curves? Do household members effectively pool income? Are there constraints to savings? Do transfers generate externalities? In addition, we study in detail the effects of transfers on psychological well-being and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. We randomized at both the village and household levels; further, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife vs. husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer vs. monthly installments over 9 months), and transfer magnitude (USD 404 vs. USD 1,520). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in monthly consumption from USD 157 to USD 194 four months after the transfer ended. Implied expenditure elasticities for food, medical and education expenditures range between 0.84 and 1.47, while the point estimates are negative for alcohol and tobacco. Intriguingly, recipient gender does not affect the household response to the program. Households may face savings constraints: monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, while lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables. We find no evidence for externalities on non-recipients except for a significant positive spillover on female empowerment. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being, and several types of transfers lead to reductions in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on consumption and psychological well-being.},

abstract = {As a result of recent political reforms, Myanmar has the opportunity to enact major policy changes to reinvigorate its agriculture sector. In this context, Myanmar's rubber sector has the potential to become an even greater source of export earnings and rural household incomes, but there are major challenges related to low rubber productivity and poor rubber quality. Using data from the Mon State Rural Household Survey (MSRHS) conducted from May to June 2015, as well as qualitative data collected from rubber producer focus groups and other interviews with rubber producers, traders, and processors, this paper describes the cost structure of rubber production in Mon State. We then estimate smallholder production costs and the profitability of smallholder rubber production under various alternative yield and price scenarios. The results suggest that if the weaknesses hindering the profitability of the rubber sector are not addressed, the rubber sector will likely stagnate. Moreover, in the absence of a major increase in world prices (substantially above the 2000–2016 average), new rubber investments will not be profitable without major improvements in yield and quality. Further, increasing only yields or only quality, or only improving the institutional environment, will not result in positive returns on investment for smallholders; reforms are needed in all three areas. If these weaknesses are addressed, however, Myanmar's new investments will be profitable and Myanmar could become an important rubber producer and exporter on the world stage.},

Consequently, this paper introduces an applied framework, named the kaleidoscope model, to analyze drivers of change in the food security arena, with a specific emphasis on agriculture and nutrition policies. Focusing on five key elements of the policy cycle—agenda setting, design, adoption, implementation, and evaluation and reform—the model identifies key variables that define the necessary and sufficient conditions for policy change to occur. These variables were inductively derived through an extensive review of the secondary literature on episodes of policy change in developing countries across a broad range of policy domains related to food security, including agriculture, education, healthcare, nutrition, and social protection.},

Defining poverty based on PPP{\$}2 per capita consumption, community targeting and the hybrid perform somewhat worse in identifying the poor than PMT, though not by enough to significantly affect poverty outcomes for a typical program. Elite capture does not explain these results. Instead, communities appear to apply a different concept of poverty. Consistent with this finding, community targeting results in higher satisfaction.

abstract = {Using detailed survey data from Uganda, this article examines whether coffee producers sell to itinerant traders or directly to markets, where they can get a higher price but must incur a transport cost. We find that selling to the market is more likely when the quantity sold is large and the market is close by. Wealthy farmers are less likely to sell to the market, possibly because the shadow value of their time is higher. But if they have a large quantity of coffee for sale, they are more likely to sell it to the market. They are also more likely to travel to a distant market. These findings are consistent with their better ability to pay for public transportation. We find no evidence that the decision to sell at the farmgate is driven by a self-control motive.},

abstract = {Wellbeing is gaining prominence in international development discourse as an alternative means of conceptualising and assessing progress against human development goals. This paper operationalizes the concept of social wellbeing (comprised of interlinked material, subjective and relational dimensions) as a framework for understanding the effects of agrarian change, as experienced by inhabitants of two villages in rural Southwest Bangladesh. Production of two ostensibly similar high value export crops (tiger shrimp and freshwater prawn) resulted in radically different trajectories of agrarian change and social wellbeing outcomes in the two villages. These were broadly positive in the village producing prawn, but broadly negative in the village producing shrimp. The paper links these divergent wellbeing outcomes to the ways in which peasant livelihoods became commodified in each village. Different patterns of commodification are shown to be linked to differences in the biological characteristics of the two organisms farmed. The paper demonstrates the theoretical, methodological and analytical utility of integrating social wellbeing and political economy of agrarian change perspectives in the study of rural development.},

The severity of the losses varies with the dependence on agricultural income, supporting the notion of diversifying portfolio strategies in rural areas to reduce climate-related income risk.},

abstract = {This chapter surveys existing approaches to modeling labor supply and identifies important gaps in the literature that could be addressed in future research. The discussion begins with a look at recent policy reforms and labor market facts that motivate the study of labor supply. The analysis then presents a unifying framework that allows alternative empirical formulations of the labor supply model to be compared and their resulting elasticities to be interpreted. This is followed by critical reviews of alternative approaches to labor-supply modeling. The first review assesses the difference-in-differences approach and its relationship to natural experiments. The second analyzes estimation with non-linear budget constraints and welfare-program participation. The third appraises developments of family labor-supply models including both the standard unitary and collective labor-supply formulations. The fourth briefly explores dynamic extensions of the labor supply model, characterizing how participation decisions, learning-by-doing, human capital accumulation and habit formation affect the analysis of the lifecycle model. At the end of each of the four broad reviews, we summarize a selection of the recent empirical findings. The concluding section asks whether the developments reviewed in this chapter place us in a better position to answer the policy-reform questions and to interpret the trends in participation and hours with which we began this review.},

The depression index of both groups also decreased, but only significantly among bereaved parents. Of bereaved parents, those with fewer years of education had more severe symptoms at both waves. Depressive symptom severity of bereaved mothers improved over time, but that of bereaved fathers remained unchanged. Not becoming pregnant again after the earthquake was significantly linked to worse depressive symptoms in both waves, but this was not significant when age was added to the model. Bereaved parents may need more postearthquake supportive services, with fathers, individuals with fewer years of education, and parents who are not able to become pregnant again after the earthquake being particularly vulnerable.},

During this period the World Bank has played a key role in shaping policy reform through its Adjustment Loans. Three distinct reform phases can be identified: 1981-87 when policy was dominated by the dogmatism of the World Bank's "pricist and state minimalist" policies; 1988-94 when a more flexible position was taken by both the Bank and the Malawi Government both of whom acknowledged the structuralist critique of earlier policies; and 1994 to the present when the reform process in agriculture became more politicized and a schism developed between the Bank and the Government. This latter period is used to illustrate some of the unresolved policy issues pertaining to similar low-income agrarian economies.},

We found no strong evidence that the PSNP protects livestock in times of shock. Shocks appear to lead households to disinvest in livestock, but not in trees. Our results suggest that there is increased forestry activity as a result of PSNP, and that improved credit access encourages households to increase their livestock holdings.},

abstract = {We use a principal-agent framework and data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey between 1994 and 2004 to understand biases in the distribution of food aid in Ethiopia. We show that even when aid is systematically misallocated, aid recipients may match official classifications of needy households if agents deviate from allocation rules in ways that are difficult to monitor. Agent behavior is therefore best understood by comparing aid along dimensions of need that are visible to the principal with those that are difficult to observe outside the village. We do this by using data on a panel of 943 households observed over six rounds of the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey. In support of our model, we find that while the demographics of aid recipients do match official criteria, disbursements are increasing in pre-aid consumption, self-reported power and involvement in village-level organizations. We conclude that the extent to which food aid insulates some of the world's poorest families from agricultural shocks depends on a nuanced interaction of policy constraints and informal structures of local power. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Clear and consistent patterns of correlations between self-imposed delay time in preschool and later ratings were found for both sexes over this time span. Delay behavior predicted a set of cognitive and social competencies and stress tolerance consistent with experimental analyses of the process underlying effective delay in the preschool delay situation. Specifically, children who were able to wait longer at age 4 or 5 became adolescents whose parents rated them as more academically and socially competent, verbally fluent, rational, attentive, planful, and able to deal well with frustration and stress. Comparisons with related longitudinal research using other delay situations help to clarify the important features of the situations and person variables involved in different aspects of delay of gratification.},

An important question is therefore whether risk-sharing within the household is effective.

Even though the shocks were small relative to lifetime income, men increase private consumption when they receive the shock but not when their wives do, a rejection of efficiency. Such behavior is not specific to the experiment—both spouses spend more on themselves when their labor income is higher. (JEL D14, D81, G22, O12, O16)},

abstract = {We analyze how one of the central drivers of globalization, foreign direct investment (FDI), relates to the prevalence of corruption. According to received wisdom, the link between globalization and corruption depends on the presence of proper political institutions and practices. We develop an alternative explanation that looks at the effect of inward FDI on host market dynamics, which in turn affect the opportunities for rent creation. We argue that, in less developed countries, FDI inflows can increase market concentration, resulting in higher rents that public officials can demand from market actors. Yet, the positive association between inward investment and corruption is mitigated in more developed economies. There, foreign entry into a market populated by productive indigenous firms promotes competition and reduces rents. This lowers opportunities for corrupt behavior. We test this nonlinear relationship between FDI and corruption in an instrumental variable two-stage least squares setting. The results indicate that FDI is indeed associated with higher levels of corruption in less developed countries, but not in developed countries. Our findings highlight the role of globalization in shaping host countries' market dynamics, which often set the parameters of political outcomes.},

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), launched in 2003, was intended to prevent the impoverishment due to catastrophic illness costs. Previous studies have been conducted on the "design flows" of the NCMS, for example, the irrational insurance benefit package. But after several years of implementation, very little has been known about the improvements made by the NCMS and rural residents' attitudes toward it. This article specifically focused on the improvements of healthcare services and the enrollees' choices of providers since the implementation of the NCMS in Liaoning province.

METHODS: We conducted a one-on-one interview with healthcare officials in order to get a better understanding of the NCMS policies of the local area. We conducted a door-to-door survey in 3 counties, 21 villages and 602 households to gauge population characteristics, respondents' healthcare preferences, satisfaction levels with providers, and their attitudes towards designated healthcare institutions.

RESULTS: We found that 43.6{\%} of the respondents believed the NCMS brought more convenience to receive healthcare services. 35.2{\%} of the rural residents thought the NCMS work ineffectively, mainly due to the high healthcare costs. 72.3{\%} of the respondents preferred the county hospitals when they got severe diseases, mainly for the reason of better skills and more advanced equipment, while they preferred village clinics (56.5{\%}) and township hospitals (23.2{\%}) when they got minor diseases mainly for the reason of convenience.

CONCLUSION: We concluded that the NCMS improved the situation of hard to receive healthcare services but did not reduce the high healthcare fees. Furthermore, participants were unsatisfied with the NCMS designated hospitals. Based on our findings, a number of remedial actions were proposed, including redistributing healthcare resources, developing more domestic medical equipment to lower the treatment costs, and establishing a new talent flow mode.},

abstract = {Summary This paper studies the directions of commodity and labor flows between two countries where the population in one country is relatively younger and grows faster than the other by using results obtained under alternative simulation scenarios within the framework of a dynamic/overlapping-generations general equilibrium model. The differing age profiles are shown to create wage and rental rate differentials under autarky. This causes costs of production and relative prices to differ, providing the grounds for trade. Furthermore, should labor mobility across countries be allowed, wage differentials provide incentives for workers to migrate from the high population growth country to the other.},

Unlike the familiar case first examined by Sandmo, output depends on both ordinal preferences for goods and on risk attitudes. Conditions are found that yield an output level under risk that is smaller than under certainty. If these conditions do not hold, both risk and risk aversion may have a positive effect on output. Implications for econometric studies of risk attitudes are considered and illustrated with an example. Finally, we examine the effect of uncertainty on the peasant's long-run equilibrium.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the economic effects of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country as a case study. Our analysis rests on two different strategies. First, we use a combination of other regions to construct a "synthetic" control region which resembles many relevant economic characteristics of the Basque Country before the outset of political terrorism in the 1970's. The subsequent economic evolution of this "counterfactual" Basque Country without terrorism is compared to the actual experience of the Basque Country. We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percent points relative to the synthetic control region. Moreover, this gap seemed to widen in response to spikes in terrorist activity. The second part of this study uses the truce declared in September 1998 as a natural experiment to estimate the effects of the conflict. If the terrorist conflict was perceived to have a negative impact on the Basque economy, stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country should have shown a positive relative performance as the truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire. We find evidence that is consistent with this conjecture using event study methods.},

abstract = {This article examines how data on INS border apprehensions are related to the flow of undocumented migrants crossing the southern U.S. border. Its centerpiece is a demographic model of the process of unauthorized migration across the Mexico-U.S. frontier. This model is both a conceptual framework that allows us to see theoretical linkages between apprehensions and illegal migrant flows, and a methodological device that yields estimates of the gross number of undocumented migrants. One implication of the model is that, for the first time, the relation between apprehensions and illegal flows can be examined empirically. We show that the ratio in each period between apprehensions and the undocumented flow is simply the odds of being located and arrested on any given attempt to enter the United States clandestinely. In addition, data for 1977-1988 suggest that the simple linear correlation between the number of apprehensions and the volume of illegal immigration is approximately 0.90 and that the size of the illegal migrant flow is roughly 2.2 times the number of Border Patrol arrests. The article concludes with a discussion of the conditions under which it is appropriate to use INS apprehensions data as an indicator for the flow of undocumented U.S. migrants.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the incidence and severity of health payment-induced poverty of rural households under the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural Shandong, China. METHOD: We collected primary data from a household survey to identify catastrophic health payments and measure associated health payment-induced poverty in a county of Shandong province. From a stratified random cluster sample of 3101 households, 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments were identified and interviewed. A validity test of the screening method was conducted, from which we obtained the adjusted total number of households with catastrophic payments in the sample of 3101. The health payment-induced poverty incidence and severity were compared without and with NCMS reimbursements. RESULTS: Before the NCMS intervention, 5.06{\%} of the sample households fell below the national poverty line due to health payments in 2004, compared with 4.03{\%} after reimbursements. With NCMS reimbursements, the health payment-induced poverty gap of those households still remaining below the Chinese national poverty line dropped by 19.2{\%} to an average of 977.2 Yuan. CONCLUSION: Out-of-pocket health payments remain a severe burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS was limited.},

Although the nature of the shocks in the two countries were similar, the impact on farmers' income (particularly on distribution) was quite different. In Thailand, poor farmers bore the brunt of the crisis, in part because of their greater reliance on the urban economy, than did poor farmers in Indonesia. Urban-rural links are much weaker in Indonesia. Farmers in both countries, particularly those specializing in export crops, benefited from the currency devaluation. Although there is some evidence that the productivity of the smallest landholders declined over the period in question, it is difficult to attribute this directly to the financial crisis. At least in Thailand, a rural credit crunch does not seem to have materialized.},

abstract = {Much has been written on the determinants of technology adoption in agriculture, with issues such as input availability, knowledge and education, risk preferences, profitability, and credit constraints receiving much attention. This paper focuses on a factor that has been less well documented: the differential ability of households to take on risky production technologies for fear of the welfare consequences if shocks result in poor harvests. Building on an explicit model, this is explored in panel data from Ethiopia. Historical rainfall distributions are used to identify consumption risk. Controlling for unobserved household and time-varying village characteristics, it emerges that not just ex ante credit constraints, but also the possibly low consumption outcomes when harvests fail, discourage the application of fertilizer. The lack of insurance or alternative means of keeping consumption smooth leaves some trapped in low return, lower risk agriculture, one of the mechanisms through which poverty perpetuates itself in agrarian settings. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Innovation System research, this paper presents an extensive literature review on this large field of innovation research. Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities “system” and “innovation”, the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive table of comparison is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes.},

abstract = {The [`]modernist' project that has come to dominate food and agricultural policy has failed to provide sustainable outcomes for many poor people in developing countries. Conventional agricultural science is not able to explain let alone address these concerns because it is based on a static equilibrium-centred view that provides little insight into the dynamic character of agri-food systems. This paper analyses how prevailing narratives of technological change and economic growth have come to dominate key food and agriculture policy debates. It seeks to counter these orthodox notions by emphasising that agri-food systems are embedded in complex ecological, economic and social processes, and showing how their interactions are dynamic and vulnerable to short-term shocks and long-term stresses like climate change. The paper makes the case for a deeper understanding of diverse [`]rural worlds' and their potential pathways to sustainability through agriculture. Moreover, it argues for a normative focus on poverty reduction and concern for the distributional consequences of dynamic changes in agri-food systems, rather than aggregates and averages. Finally, it sets out an interdisciplinary research agenda on agri-food systems that focuses on dynamic system interactions in complex, risk-prone environments and explores how pathways can become more resilient and robust in an era of growing risk and uncertainty.},

The model's explicit consideration of forward-looking investment decisions and adjustment dynamics permits assessments of short-run effects of tax policy on asset values as well as long-term impacts on capital accumulation. Simulations reveal that effects on asset values and investment depend critically on whether policies are oriented toward new or old capital. Investment tax credits yield significant increases in investment without conferring windfall gains to corporate shareholders. Corporate tax cuts with the same revenue cost, on the other hand, yield large windfalls to shareholders while providing only a modest investment stimulus. Incidence and growth effects differ considerably across sectors, particularly between business and housing.},

Certification regulations for the import of organic products are very rigorous and smallholder farmers, in common with all farmers, must comply with a complex array of rules and procedures to access this market. This paper investigates the many challenges faced by smallholder farmers in acquiring certification as well as the benefits to farmers of being able to export certified organic produce. Certification costs are high but, as the paper explains, can be overcome by smallholders forming producer groups, acquiring external funding, selling on contract and, in some countries, being able to utilize national rather than EU certification bodies. The bureaucracy and paperwork of certification are problematic to smallholders, who must also choose the ‘right' certifier to ensure acceptance in the market. Another issue for smallholders examined in the paper is the necessity for reliable marketing linkages. Although there are obs...},

abstract = {Following a precise evaluation protocol that was applied to a pool of 202 articles published between 2003 and 2014, this paper evaluates the existing evidence of how and to what extent capture fisheries and aquaculture contribute to improving nutrition, food security, and economic growth in developing and emergent countries. In doing so we evaluate the quality and scientific rigor of that evidence, identify the key conclusions that emerge from the literature, and assess whether these conclusions are consistent across the sources. The results of the assessment show that while some specific topics are consistently and rigorously documented, thus substantiating some of the claims found in the literature, other areas of research still lack the level of disaggregated data or an appropriate methodology to reach consistency and robust conclusions. More specifically, the analysis reveals that while fish contributes undeniably to nutrition and food security, the links between fisheries/aquaculture and poverty alleviation are complex and still unclear. In particular national and household level studies on fisheries' contributions to poverty alleviation lack good conceptual models and produce inconsistent results. For aquaculture, national and household studies tend to focus on export value chains and use diverse approaches. They suggest some degree of poverty alleviation and possibly other positive outcomes for adopters, but these outcomes also depend on the small-scale farming contexts and on whether adoption was emergent or due to development assistance interventions. Impacts of fish trade on food security and poverty alleviation are ambiguous and confounded by a focus on international trade and a lack of consistent methods. The influences of major drivers (decentralization, climate change, demographic transition) are still insufficiently documented and therefore poorly understood. Finally the evaluation reveals that evidence-based research and policy narratives are often disconnected, with some of the strongest and long-lasting policy narratives lacking any strong and rigorous evidence-based validation. Building on these different results, this paper identifies six key gaps facing policy-makers, development practitioners, and researchers.},

This year's report takes a special look at how food systems can best contribute to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on rigorous research, IFPRI researchers and other distinguished food policy experts consider a wide range of crucial questions:
How can we support the critical contributions of smallholders to food security in a world facing climate change?
What are the causes and costs of food loss and waste within food systems, and how can this loss be reduced?
How can sound management of water resources provide multiple benefits for health, nutrition, and sustainability?
What policy choices can best promote sustainable management of agricultural land and soil resources and the ecosystem services they provide?
Where are the most promising opportunities for exploiting synergies between green energy and food security goals?
What changes in global diets can make the greatest contribution to food security and sustainability?
How can we use food value chains to develop effective interventions to achieve both better nutrition and sustainability?
The 2016 Global Food Policy Report also presents data for several key food policy indicators, including country-level data on hunger, agricultural spending, agricultural research investment, and capacity for food policy research. In addition to illustrative figures, tables, and a timeline of food policy events in 2015, the report also presents the results of a global opinion poll on the current state of food policy.},

In this paper, we use a series of one-year long panels to study who gained the most in pesos when the economy grew and who lost the most in pesos when the economy contracted. Various considerations led us to expect that mobility would be divergent—that is, that the individuals who started with the highest initial earnings would enjoy the largest earnings gains in pesos. Contrary to expectations and for a wide range of specifications, mobility is found to be mostly convergent, sometimes neutral, and never divergent.},

abstract = {Building on an idea in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), this article investigates the application of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies. We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

Cutbacks in public expenditure have tended to worsen these distortions and crowd-out women's contributions to economic growth.

This opens the way for examining taxation and expenditure through a gender lens to reveal how spreading the burden of the "reproduction tax" can promote the development of well-functioning labor markets and contribute to equitable and sustainable growth.},

We report Monte-Carlo confidence bounds around impact-simulation results. We find significant spillovers to nonrecipient households and significant real income multipliers, although the latter are dampened if factor supply constraints generate excessive inflationary pressures. Our findings raise questions about how to measure the impacts of cash transfers. Evaluations focusing only on eligible households are likely to significantly understate program impacts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Medicare Part D has reduced racial/ethnic disparities in prescription drug utilization and spending. DATA: Nationally representative data on white, African American, and Hispanic Medicare seniors from the 2002-2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey are analyzed. Five measures are examined: filling any prescriptions during the year, the number of prescriptions filled, total annual prescription spending, annual out-of-pocket prescription spending, and average copay level. STUDY DESIGN: We apply the Institute of Medicine's definition of a racial/ethnic disparity and adopt a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) estimator using a multivariate regression framework. The treatment group consists of Medicare seniors, the comparison group, adults without Medicare aged 55-63 years. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Difference-in-difference-in-differences estimates suggest that for African Americans Part D increased the disparity in annual spending on prescription drugs by {\$}258 (p=.011), yet had no effect on other measures of prescription drug disparities. For Hispanics, DDD estimates suggest that the program reduced the disparities in annual number of prescriptions filled, annual total and out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs by 2.9 (p=.077), {\$}282 (p=.019) and {\$}143 (p{\textless}.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Medicare Part D had mixed effects. Although it reduced Hispanic/white disparities related to prescription drugs among seniors, it increased the African American/white disparity in total annual spending on prescription drugs.},

It investigates whether female-headed households are more likely to report experiencing a food price shock, and whether female-headed households experiencing a shock are more (or less) likely to adopt certain coping strategies, controlling for individual, household, and community characteristics. Our findings suggest that female-headed households are more vulnerable to food price changes and are more likely to have experienced a food price shock in 2007–2008. Because female-headed households are also resource poor and have a larger food gap compared with male-headed households, they cope by cutting back on the number of meals they provide their households during good months and eating less preferred foods in general. A combination of short-term measures to protect diet diversity and micronutrient consumption of vulnerable groups and longer-term measures to promote investment in sustainable agriculture, such as strengthening women's property rights, may increase the ability of poor and vulnerable households to cope better with food price increases.},

The premise of the article is that the effect of beliefs on online purchase behavior is moderated by demographic characteristics such as income, education, and generational age, and by consumption values such as the inclination to consider many alternatives before making a choice, the enjoyment of shopping, and the tendency to research products prior to making a purchase. The findings on how beliefs and consumption values influence purchase behavior can assist online retailers formulate product positioning strategies that create more value for consumer segments through better customization, thereby enhancing retailer profits. The findings can also help public policy makers design communication strategies to help lower-income consumers realize the same benefits of e-commerce as their higher-income counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc.},

We estimate these losses under a variety of assumptions about what "business as usual" and "conservation" might entail. We also consider the sensitivity of income losses to variations in our model's parameter values and to some of its maintained hypothesis. In a context where lumber's initial contribution to aggregate income is around 2 percent, we estimate that a switch from lumber to nonlumber uses of tropical forests could cost up to 4 percent of baseline income. Of broader significance is the implication that the associated dynamic general equilibrium multipliers are consistently greater than unity, and often close to two in value. These large income multipliers are observed despite an assumed recovery of income through the reallocation of mobile factors initially employed in lumber activities, and an increase in returns to capital. In this study, a terms of trade deterioration, prompted by the loss of lumber foreign exchange revenue, accounts for about one-half of the total income losses we observe. For economies that rely to a greater extent than Malaysia on lumber foreign exchange revenue, these terms of trade-induced losses could be more important still. From a policy perspective, our results provide a benchmark against which the contingent valuations and other imputations of the monetary value of nonlumber use values of tropical forests may be gauged.},

While there is not much debate about the positive contribution of migration and local off-farm employment to China's economy, there is an increasing concern about the potential negative effects of moving labor away from agriculture on China's future food security. This is a critical issue as maintaining self-sufficiency in grain production will be critical for China to feed its huge population in the future.},

abstract = {Monetary transactions in which consumption is temporally separated from purchase naturally lend themselves to multiple frames and to alternative accounting schemes, which nonetheless maintain a modicum of discipline and authenticity. We investigate some of the relevant accounting rules, and find that advanced purchases (e.g., a case of wine) are typically treated as "investments" rather than spending. At the same time, consumption of a good purchased earlier and used as planned (a wine bottle opened for dinner) is often coded as "free", or even as savings. However, when it is not consumed as planned (a bottle is dropped and broken), then the relevant account, long dormant, is resuscitated and costs associated with the event are perceived as the cost of replacing the good, especially if replacement is actually likely. Related phenomena and assorted implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A households observed poverty status is an ex-post measure of a house- holds well-being (or lack thereof). But for thinking about forward-looking anti-poverty interventions that aim to prevent rather than alleviate poverty, what really matters is the vulnerability of households to poverty, i.e., the ex- ante risk that a household will, if currently non-poor, fall below the poverty line, or if currently poor, will remain in poverty. Ideally, vulnerability at the household level would be estimated with panel data of sufficient length and rich- ness. However, such data are rare, especially in poor, developing economies. We argue in this paper that despite the limitations of purely cross-sectional data, an analysis of these data can potentially be informative. We lay out a simple and fairly flexible methodology for empirically assessing household vul- nerability to poverty using cross-sectional survey data, and demonstrate the uses and limitations of the proposed methods through a case study using data from the December 1998 mini-SUSENAS survey from Indonesia.},

abstract = {Two prominent features of international labor movements are that the more educated are more likely to emigrate (positive selection) and more educated migrants are more likely to settle in destination countries with high rewards to skill (positive sorting). Using data on emigrant stocks by schooling level and source country in OECD destinations, we find that a simple model of income maximization can account for both phenomena. Results on selection show that migrants for a source-destination pair are more educated relative to non-migrants the larger is the absolute skill-related difference in earnings between the destination country and the source. Results on sorting indicate that the relative stock of more educated migrants in a destination is increasing in the absolute earnings difference between high and low-skilled workers. We use our framework to compare alternative specifications of international migration, estimate the magnitude of migration costs by source-destination pair, and assess the contribution of wage differences to how migrants sort themselves across destination countries. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Agriculture accounts for over half of Ethiopian GDP, yet the case for agriculture as a focus of economic growth strategies must rely on identifying a set of intersectoral linkages through which agricultural growth contributes to the growth of non-agriculture in the Ethiopian economy. This article develops a four-sector numerical simulation model of economic growth in Ethiopia which permits the calculation of macroeconomic growth multipliers resulting from income shocks to agriculture, services, modern industry, and traditional industry. The resulting growth multipliers are 1.54 for agriculture, 1.80 for services, 1.34 for modern industry, and 1.22 for traditional industry. These results depict an economy in which intersectoral linkages operate on a highly uneven basis. These limits are reflected in the wide disparity between sectoral growth multipliers and by substantial differences in the patterns of their decomposition. The policy relevance of these findings relate, in part, to the distributional implications of growth in particular sectors. Poverty in Ethiopia is disproportionately rural. An income shock to agriculture is clearly the most progressive choice, indicating the need to highlight agricultural development in growth strategies for Ethiopia. Yet, the simulation results further indicate that doing so imposes relatively little trade off against total benefit. While a {\$}1 service sector income shock generates {\$}0.80 in indirect benefits, a {\$}1 agricultural income shock still generates {\$}0.54 in indirect gains – a somewhat smaller benefit, but one likely to make the greatest possible impact on poverty reduction.},

Specifically, we show that a new rice variety that reduces downside risk by providing flood tolerance has positive effects on adoption of a more labor-intensive planting method, area cultivated, fertilizer usage, and credit demand. We find that a large share of the expected gains from the technology comes from crowding in of other investments. Therefore, improved technologies that reduce risk by protecting production in bad years have the potential to increase agricultural productivity in normal years. (JEL O13, O33, Q14, Q15, Q16)},

@article{Meng2001,
abstract = {China had separate rural and urban labor markets for about 40 years until the late 1980's when the restrictions on rural–urban migration were gradually eased. By the end of the 1980's and in the early 1990's, the number of rural migrants working in the urban areas began to increase dramatically. However, rural migrants are treated differently from their urban counterparts in terms of occupational attainment and wages. This paper utilizes two comparable survey data sets to analyze the degree to which the segregation between rural migrants and urban residents has occurred from the point of view of occupational segregation and wage differentials. A significant difference in occupational attainment and wages exists between rural migrants and urban residents. Most of the difference cannot be explained by productivity-related differences between the two groups, implying that urban residents are favorably treated while their migrant counterparts are discriminated against.

Subsidizing the prices of dietary staples for extremely poor households in two provinces of China, we find strong evidence of Giffen behavior for rice in Hunan, and weaker evidence for wheat in Gansu. The data provide new insight into the consumption behavior of the poor, who act as though maximizing utility subject to subsistence concerns. We find that their elasticity of demand depends significantly, and nonlinearly, on the severity of their poverty. Understanding this heterogeneity is important for the effective design of welfare programs for the poor. (JEL D12, O12).},

abstract = {The full insurance model is tested using data from three poor, high risk villages in the semi-arid tropics of southern India. The model presented here incorporates a number of salient features of the actual village economies. Although the model is rejected statistically, it does provide a surprisingly good benchmark. Household consumptions comove with village average consumption. More clearly, household consumptions are not much influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e. for village level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1994 The Econometric Society},

abstract = {Academic experts frequently recommend policies and treatments. But how well do they anticipate the impact of different treatments? And how do their predictions compare to the predictions of non-experts? We analyze how 208 experts forecast the results of 15 treatments involving monetary and non-monetary motivators in a real-effort task. We compare these forecasts to those made by PhD students and non-experts: undergraduates, MBAs, and an online sample. We document seven main results. First, the average forecast of experts predicts quite well the experimental results. Second, there is a strong wisdom-of-crowds effect: the average forecast outperforms 96 percent of individual forecasts. Third, correlates of expertise---citations, academic rank, field, and contextual experience--do not improve forecasting accuracy. Fourth, experts as a group do better than non-experts, but not if accuracy is defined as rank ordering treatments. Fifth, measures of effort, confidence, and revealed ability are predictive of forecast accuracy to some extent, especially for non-experts. Sixth, using these measures we identify `superforecasters' among the non-experts who outperform the experts out of sample. Seventh, we document that these results on forecasting accuracy surprise the forecasters themselves. We present a simple model that organizes several of these results and we stress the implications for the collection of forecasts of future experimental results.},

Regression analyses showed that students who, before the earthquake, already had elevated levels of depression and stress symptoms and a ruminative style of responding to their symptoms had more depression and stress symptoms for both follow-ups. Students who were exposed to more dangerous or difficult circumstances because of the earthquake also had elevated symptom levels 10 days after the earthquake. Similarly, students who, during the 10 days after the earthquake, had more ruminations about the earthquake were still more likely to have high levels of depressive and stress symptoms 7 wks after the earthquake.

abstract = {This paper uses panel data from rounds V-IX of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) to examine the extent to which households are able to protect their consumption from fluctuations in their income. It is found that consumption is only partially protected from idiosyncratic shocks to income with food consumption being better protected than non-food consumption expenditures. This suggests that adjustments in non-food expenditures may be an important component of the risk management tools of Russian households. The analysis also provides evidence on the extent and nature of the coping strategies adopted by households. It is demonstrated that households complement their self-insurance strategies, of borrowing, adjusting their labour supply, and selling assets, with informal risk sharing arrangements with households within their community. An examination of the role of sample selection confirmed that these findings are quite robust to this potential source of bias. Furthermore, accounting for the role of measurement and imputation errors in the measure of household income revealed that OLS estimates may yield a misleading picture about the extent to which urban and rural households are insured from idiosyncratic income shocks.},

The direction of the empirical relationship between changes in inequality and poverty after the drought depends critically on environmental variables and on apparent constraints on income diversification at different points in the income distribution.

Several factors explain the use and use intensity of agricultural mechanization, including landholding size, total labor and fertilizer use per hectare, chemical use, and amount of land left fallow. More importantly, the results suggest that farm mechanization did have a positive impact on cropland expansion during the survey period.

In this article, we present a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for analyzing the effects of alternative integration strategies in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. The CGE model simulates the static and dynamic effects of alternative integration scenarios on production, income distribution, and the flows of trade, capital, and labor migration. The results point to a number of essential strategic choices that will have to be made in order to generate the most optimal regional outcome. Such an outcome will be possible if and only if: (1) the United States is able to overcome a domestic political economy debate on the distribution of the gains from trade which could then allow it to provide a strategic leadership role in the region, and (2) the Latin American countries in the region resolve an almost classic "prisoner's dilemma" collective action problem. As a NAFTA partner with veto power, Mexico thus must make a key decision: to share the NAFTA market with its competitors or to block NAFTA accession and risk unilateral U.S. FTAs with Mexico's rivals and geopolitical neighbors.},

However, no published study to date has investigated whether disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction workers involved in later phases of the earthquake response are also affected by emotional problems. A nearly complete sample of earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction workers (N=267) involved in the response to the 2005 earthquake in Northern Pakistan filled in a set of self-report questionnaires assessing emotional problems and predictor variables approximately 24 months after the earthquake. Most participants had experienced the disaster themselves and suffered from a number of stressors during and shortly after the acute earthquake phase. A substantial subgroup of participants reported clinically relevant levels of emotional disorders, especially earthquake-related posttraumatic stress disorder (42.6{\%}), as well as depression and anxiety (approx. 20{\%}). Levels of burnout were low. Symptom levels of posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with the severity of the earthquake experience, past traumas, work-related stressors, low social support, and female gender. The results document a high prevalence of emotional problems in earthquake rehabilitation and recovery workers.},

Results suggest that trappers continue to participate in trapping for a variety of sociocultural values and motivations, including the multiple satisfactions derived From involvement in an enduring recreational central life interest. Trapping to procure income and to provide in-kind contributions to the household economy represent important motives and meanings to a smaller segment of the respondent population.},

abstract = {We analyze economic life in three Congolese refugee camps in Rwanda and the interactions between refugees and local host-country economies within a 10-km radius around each camp. Refugees in one of the three camps received food aid in kind, while in the other two camps they were given cash via cell phones provided by the UN World Food Programme. We find that refugee economies arise inside each camp, and the structure of these economies reflects the economic context around the camps. Despite undergoing forced migration and often living in destitute conditions, refugees actively interact with host country economies. Interactions with the host country result in a divergence of refugee households' income from the assistance they receive. A shift from in-kind to cash aid appears to increase refugee welfare while strengthening market linkages between camp and host economies. This finding is potentially important for refugee policies as well as for other types of development assistance, as donors find themselves under pressure to shift from in-kind to cash aid.},

abstract = {Despite being a low-income, agriculture-based country with a subsistence orientation, Laos is in the early stages of a major economic transformation whereby rural households have been experiencing rapid change in their farming and livelihood systems. Some households have begun to engage in semi-commercial farming while others have adopted labour-oriented or migration-oriented livelihood strategies. This paper explores how rural households in six villages in the lowlands of Champasak Province in southern Laos make a living. These villages vary in their access to irrigation and to markets. Nevertheless, in all villages, long-term migration of younger household members to neighbouring Thailand has come to play a large role in household livelihood strategies. In some cases this is necessary to meet the household's consumption requirements; in most, it is part of a diversified strategy in which rice farming still plays a significant role, though still largely for subsistence. The paper examines some of the issues involved in attempting to promote intensive, market-oriented rice farming in a context of an emerging on-farm labour shortage combined with an increasing flow of remittances from migrant family members.},

abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that global trade reforms are unlikely to produce analogous results across countries, especially when analyzing their effect on poverty. This implies that the analysis of trade reform on social welfare cannot be generalized and needs to be conducted on a country by country basis. Moreover, even within the same country, geographic areas, households, and individuals are likely to be differentially affected, some of them benefiting more than others, while others might lose. With this in mind, the author provides a quantitative estimate of the effect on Mexican households from the implementation of the Doha development agenda. His analysis uses a two-step approach for which changes in prices and factors are estimated through a CGE model (GTAP) and then mapped into the welfare function of the household using household survey data. The empirical approach the author uses aims to measure the impact of Doha implementation by tracing changes in the household prices of goods and factors and their impact on household welfare, taking particular account the role of domestic price transmission. The findings suggest that multilateral trade liberalization alone would have a negative effect on Mexican households, even though very small. However, when the implementation of the Doha development agenda is complemented by domestic policies aimed at increasing productivity and improving domestic price transmission, the overall effects become positive. The results point to the importance of domestic price transmission in determining the variance of the effects across households.},

Evidence from a variety of identification strategies suggests that the relationship is causal. Examining causal mecha- nisms, we show that most of the impact of the slave trade is through factors that are internal to the individual, such as cultural norms, beliefs, and values.},

@article{Blumenstock2016,
abstract = {Policy-makers in the world's poorest countries are often forced to make decisions based on limited data. Consider Angola, which recently conducted its first postcolonial census. In the 44 years that elapsed between the prior census and the recent one, the country's population grew from 5.6 million to 24.3 million, and the country experienced a protracted civil war that displaced millions of citizens. In situations where reliable survey data are missing or out of date, a novel line of research offers promising alternatives. On page 790 of this issue, Jean et al. (1) apply recent advances in machine learning to high-resolution satellite imagery to accurately measure regional poverty in Africa. Traditionally, wealth and poverty are measured through surveys of household income and consumption (2). These data provide a critical input to the world's most prominent antipoverty programs, from basic cash transfer programs to multifaceted aid programs designed to target the extreme poor (3). However, nationally representative surveys cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to collect, and many developing countries go for decades without updating their estimates. Over the past few decades, researchers have begun to develop different techniques for estimating poverty remotely. Initial work explored the potential of “nightlights” data: satellite photographs taken at night that capture light emitted from Earth's surface. Since such imagery first became available in the early 1970s, it was evident that wealthy regions tended to shine brightest (4). Recent studies have found a strong correlation between nightlight luminosity and traditional measures of economic productivity and growth (5, 6). Nightlight-based measures are now frequently used by researchers, for instance to study the impact of sanctions on the economy of North Korea (7), where official statistics are dubious. A series of studies in wealthy nations explore how data from the internet and social media can provide proxies for economic activity (8, 9). Mining the tweets and search queries of millions of individuals promises real-time alternatives to more traditional methods of data collection. However, these approaches are less relevant to remote and developing regions, where internet infrastructure is limited and few people use social media. In developing countries, researchers have found ways to measure wealth and poverty using the digital footprints left behind in the transaction logs of mobile phones, which are increasingly ubiquitous even in very poor regions. Regional patterns of mobile phone use correlate with the regional distribution of wealth (10). This relationship persists at the individual level, such that machine learning algorithms can infer an individual subscriber's socioeconomic status directly from his or her history of mobile phone use. The individual predictions can be aggregated into regional measures of wealth that are about as accurate as a 5-year-old household survey (11). Phone-based proxies for wealth are beginning to be used in research, e.g., to understand how new technologies differentially benefit the wealthy and the poor (12) and to assess the creditworthiness of would-be borrowers (13). Although promising, these nontraditional methods have caveats. As Jean et al. show, nightlights data are less effective at differentiating between regions at the bottom end of the income distribution, where satellite images appear uniformly dark. And mobile phone data are owned by mobile phone operators and are generally not available to policy-makers. By contrast, Jean et al. use only publicly available data. Taking nightlights as their starting point, the authors have devised a clever technique to also extract information from daytime satellite imagery. Daytime imagery is taken at much higher resolution than nighttime imagery. It thus contains visible features—such as paved roads and metal roofs—that make it possible to differentiate between poor and ultrapoor regions. Jean et al.'s insight was to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to the daytime imagery to extract these features. When given large quantities of data with labeled patterns, these algorithms excel at generalizing those patterns to new data. For instance, search engines use this technology to automatically label the contents of billions of internet photos. The authors use a convolutional neural network to learn the relationship between millions of daytime satellite images (which are rich in detail) and nighttime images (where light areas are assumed to be wealthy). In this way, the network learns which features in the daytime imagery are indicative of economic activity (see the figure). Knowledge of those features enabled the authors to accurately reconstruct survey-based indicators of regional poverty, improving on results from simpler models that relied solely on nightlights or mobile phone data. How might these results change the way that we measure and target poverty? Perhaps the most immediate application is as a source of inexpensive, interim national statistics. Jean et al.'s results indicate that a model trained in one country can be used in another, creating options for countries where no recent survey data exist. For social welfare programs, some of which already use satellite imagery to identify eligible recipients (14), higher-fidelity estimates of poverty can help to ensure that resources get to those with the greatest need. Other applications are on the horizon. Remotely sourced satellite and mobile phone data are updated frequently and can be used to generate nearly real-time estimates of regional vulnerability. Once it is possible to estimate short-term changes in wealth and poverty, new approaches to program monitoring and impact evaluation will follow.},

We first conduct an extensive review of the disparate literature studying the stability of preferences measured in experiments. Then, we test the stability of individuals' choices in panel data from rural Paraguay over almost a decade. Answers to social preference survey questions are quite stable. Experimental measures of risk, time, and social preferences do not exhibit much stability. Correlations between experimental measures of risk aversion are a more precisely estimated zero, whereas correlations for time and social preferences are larger and noisier. We also find no systematic evidence that real world shocks influence play in games. We suggest that in a developing country context researchers should explore designing simpler experiments and including survey questions in addition to experiments to measure preferences.},

A Difference-in-difference (DID) approach is employed to estimate NCMS effects. The overall effects of NCMS were modest, but differed for adults and children. We find that adults were 2.1{\%} more likely to purchase private health insurance when NCMS became available. NCMS had a larger positive effect on adult private coverage in higher income groups and in communities with a preexisting health care financing system, known as the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS). We also find evidence suggesting that NCMS crowded out child private health insurance, especially in lower income groups. However, this finding is not robust to controlling for other covariates including household characteristics and availability of private insurance in the community. For both adults and children, risk preferences and socio-economic status, including income and education, are important predictors of private insurance take-up. We find no evidence for adverse selection in the demand for private health insurance.},

Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities “system” and “innovation”, the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive table of comparison is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes.},

An alternate approach to conceptualizing diversity, based on a regional input-output model, is described and computed for the 50 states. Empirical results suggest that diversity within the theoretical construct of input-output is associated with higher levels of stability and growth.},

abstract = {China's rapid economic growth has been the proximate cause of the huge reduction in the incidence of poverty since 1980. Yet, the growth process has been highly uneven across sectors and regions. We test whether the pattern of China's growth mattered to poverty reduction using a new provincial panel data set constructed for this purpose. Our econometric tests support the view that the primary sector (mainly agriculture) has been the main driving force in poverty reduction. We note a number of similarities, and differences, with India.},

In this study, we show that the data are at least as consistent with risk aversion as they are with risk loving when one explicitly considers the skewness of bet returns. Because the variance and skewness of bet returns are highly correlated, bettors may appear to prefer variance when it is skewness that they crave.},

This paper explores how the unequal sharing of resources could potentially affect the measurement of poverty. Simulations based on micro-data from two countries (Italy and the U.S.A.) are carried out under the assumption that women "lose" and men and children "gain" because of unequal sharing in the household. Our findings suggest that if there is significant intra-household inequality of this type, as some writers have suggested, then conventional methods of poverty measurement will likely to lead to a serious under-estimate (over-estimate) of the incidence and intensity of female (male) poverty.},

abstract = {E-commerce is expanding at a tremendous rate, and the related internet pages, referred to as an electronic servicescapes (e-servicescapes) now have a significant presence in the business world. Nevertheless, understanding of e-servicescape attributes remains unclear, due to the limited empirical evidence that has been obtained and examined. Therefore, this study aims to describe the nature of e-servicescapes and investigate the relationships among website trustworthiness, website attitude, brand attitude, e-WOM intention, and purchase intention. Furthermore, this study also aims to identify the role of two contextual factors, namely online purchasing experience and gender differences, and their effects on the relationships among the e-servicescape dimensions, website trustworthiness and attitude. A total of 290 responses were collected from Taiwanese consumers using online-based questionnaires. SPSS and partial least square were used to analyze the collected data. The findings show that e-servicescape dimensions (aesthetic appeal, customization, usability, and financial security) have significant impacts on consumer attitudes and trust toward a website. In particular, women are more likely to experience more positive effects of e-servicescape on internal responses, such as website trustworthiness and attitude. In addition, purchase intention and e-WOM intention can be influenced through internal responses. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that website designers aim to improve the usability, customization, and financial security dimensions of their sites, and especially the aesthetic appeal, so the effectiveness of their designs can be optimized. It is also necessary for e-retailers to raise the top-of-the-mind awareness for their brands, as this can enhance trust in the website. In addition, marketers may add the ‘social network' factor to offer a platform on which customers can connect with friends and share their experiences with the website and brand, as this may further enhance purchase intention.},

We focus on three main areas, where in each case we highlight recommendations for applied work. First, we discuss new research on identification strategies in program evaluation, with particular focus on synthetic control methods, regression discontinuity, external validity, and the causal interpretation of regression methods. Second, we discuss various forms of supplementary analyses to make the identification strategies more credible. These include placebo analyses as well as sensitivity and robustness analyses. Third, we discuss recent advances in machine learning methods for causal effects. These advances include methods to adjust for differences between treated and control units in high-dimensional settings, and methods for identifying and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.},

It does so by addressing three main issues: the properties and reliability of the income distribution data, the robustness of the reduced form relationships between income distribution and growth estimated so far, and the specific channels through which income distribution affects growth. The main conclusion in this regard is that there is strong empirical support for two types of explanations, linking income distribution to sociopolitical instability and to the education/fertility decision. A third channel, based on the interplay of borrowing constraints and investment in human capital, also seems to receive some support by the data, although it is probably the hardest to test with the existing data. By contrast, there appears to be less empirical support for explanations based on the effects of income distribution on fiscal policy.},

abstract = {This paper examines whether the choice of crops is affected by climate in Africa. Using a multinomial logit model, the paper regresses crop choice on climate, soils, and other factors. The model is estimated using a sample of more than 7,000 farmers across 11 countries in Africa. The study finds that crop choice is very climate sensitive. For example, farmers select sorghum and maize- millet in the cooler regions of Africa; maize-beans, maize- groundnut, and maize in moderately warm regions' and cowpea, cowpea-sorghum, and millet-groundnut in hot regions. Further, farmers choose sorghum, and millet- groundnut when conditions are dry; cowpea, cowpea- sorghum, maize-millet, and maize when medium wet; and maize-beans and maize-groundnut when wet. As temperatures warm, farmers will shift toward more heat tolerant crops. Depending on whether precipitation increases or decreases, farmers will also shift toward drought tolerant or water loving crops, respectively. There are several policy relevant conclusions to draw from this study. First, farmers will adapt to climate change by switching crops. Second, global warming impact studies cannot assume crop choice is exogenous. Third, this study only examines choices across current crops. Future farmers may well have more choices. There is an important role for agronomic research in developing new varieties more suited for higher temperatures. Future farmers may have even better adaptation alternatives with an expanded set of crop choices specifically targeted at higher temperatures},

While the literature on calibration of dynamic models mainly concentrates on the process of calibration in the context of a steady state, this essay centers upon the calibration procedure for the case that the model's state variables are not initially at their steady state values. Though this is the more realistic interpretation of a base year's data set it raises a number of additional difficulties including intertemporal feedback and the requirement that the basic data are consistent with the intertemporal equations of the model. These difficulties are discussed and a procedure is presented which can cope with them. Finally, the procedure is applied to an overlapping generations growth model with foresight and the steps involved in calibration are illustrated in detail.},

abstract = {As a result of recent political reforms, Myanmar has the opportunity to enact major policy changes to reinvigorate its agriculture sector. In this context, Myanmar's rubber sector has the potential to become an even greater source of export earnings and rural household incomes, but there are major challenges related to low rubber productivity and poor rubber quality. Using data from the Mon State Rural Household Survey (MSRHS) conducted from May to June 2015, as well as qualitative data collected from rubber producer focus groups and other interviews with rubber producers, traders, and processors, this paper describes the cost structure of rubber production in Mon State. We then estimate smallholder production costs and the profitability of smallholder rubber production under various alternative yield and price scenarios. The results suggest that if the weaknesses hindering the profitability of the rubber sector are not addressed, the rubber sector will likely stagnate. Moreover, in the absence of a major increase in world prices (substantially above the 2000–2016 average), new rubber investments will not be profitable without major improvements in yield and quality. Further, increasing only yields or only quality, or only improving the institutional environment, will not result in positive returns on investment for smallholders; reforms are needed in all three areas. If these weaknesses are addressed, however, Myanmar's new investments will be profitable and Myanmar could become an important rubber producer and exporter on the world stage.},

abstract = {This paper queries the relevance of the [`]splintering urbanism' thesis to postcolonial cities of the South, and responds to calls for the production of a decentered theory of urbanization through a case study of Jakarta. Drawing on archival and interview data, the paper demonstrates that Jakarta has, since its inception, been characterized by a high degree of differentiation of access to water supply, and of fragmentation of water supply networks. We document the origins of this fragmentation in the colonial era, and trace the legacy of the colonial constructions within the postcolonial city. Moreover, we demonstrate that the introduction of private sector management (in 1988) has not significantly disrupted, and certainly not caused, this pattern. In short, we provide evidence to support our claim that Jakarta's water supply system is [`]splintered' rather than [`]splintering', and demonstrate that this phenomenon was not caused by the rise (or fall) of the [`]modern infrastructural ideal'. In order to explain this sustained fragmentation of infrastructure and access, the paper develops a conceptual framework of postcolonial governmentality that emphasizes the interrelationship between materiality, governmentality, identity, and urbanization, in particular through demonstrating how contested and evolving process of social differentiation are linked to the differentiation of water supply infrastructures and of urban spaces. Although we are wary of any simplistic comparisons between the colonial past and present, we argue that the optic of postcolonial governmentality provides a powerful lens for dissecting the power relations that continue to structure access to water supply and urban space in cities in the South.},

Using micro-level data on French manufacturing firms spanning the period 1995–2005, we show that a supply-driven increase in the share of foreign-born workers in a French d{\'{e}}partement (a small geographic area) increased the total factor productivity of firms in that d{\'{e}}partement. We also find this effect to be significantly stronger for firms with low initial productivity and small size. The positive productivity effect of immigrants was also associated with faster growth of capital, larger exports, and higher wages for natives. Highly-skilled natives, in competition with immigrants, moved towards firms hiring fewer immigrants spreading positive productivity effects to those firms too.},

abstract = {Pluripotency, virtually unlimited self-renewal and amenability to genetic modification make embryonic stem (ES) cells an attractive donor source for cell-mediated gene therapy. In this proof of concept study, we explore whether glial precursors derived from murine ES cells (ESGPs) and engineered to overexpress human arylsulfatase A (hASA) can cross-correct the metabolic defect in an animal model of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). Transfected ES cells showed an up to 30-fold increase in ASA activity. Following in vitro differentiation, high expression of ASA was found in all stages of neural and glial differentiation. hASA-overexpressing ESGPs maintained their ability to differentiate into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo. After transplantation into the brain of neonatal ASA-deficient mice, hASA-overexpressing ESGPs were found to incorporate into a variety of host brain regions. Four weeks after engraftment, immunofluorescence analyses with an antibody to sulfatide revealed a 46.7 +/- 4.0{\%} reduction of immunoreactive sulfatide deposits in the vicinity of the hASA-positive engrafted cells, thereby significantly extending the rate of sulfatide reduction achieved by the endogenous ASA activity of non-hASA-transfected control cells (21.1 +/- 5.8{\%}). These findings provide first in vivo evidence that ES cells may serve as a potential donor source for cell-mediated enzyme delivery in storage disorders such as MLD.},

abstract = {This article uses a double bootstrap procedure and survey data from Burkina Faso in a two-stage estimation to explore ways in which continental and intercontinental migration determine efficiency in cereal production of rural households. Findings suggest that continental migration has a positive relation and intercontinental migration no relation with technical efficiency. For continental migrant households, migration has removed surplus male labor, a cause for inefficiency in production. Intercontinental migration leads to a gender imbalance in the household, which cannot be compensated for by investments in farm equipment. The failure of intercontinental migration to transform cereal production from traditional to modern is attributed to an imperfect market environment.},

abstract = {9.1 Causal inference and predictive comparisons So far, we have been interpreting regressions predictively: given the values of several inputs, the fitted model allows us to predict y, considering the n data points as a simple random sample from a hypothetical infinite " superpopulation " or probability distribution. Then we can make comparisons across different combinations of values for these inputs. This chapter and the next consider causal inference, which concerns what would happen to an outcome y as a result of a hypothesized " treatment " or intervention. In a regression framework, the treatment can be written as a variable T : 1 T i = 1 if unit i receives the " treatment " 0 if unit i receives the " control, " or, for a continuous treatment, T i = level of the " treatment " assigned to unit i. In the usual regression context, predictive inference relates to comparisons between units, whereas causal inference addresses comparisons of different treatments if applied to the same units. More generally, causal inference can be viewed as a special case of prediction in which the goal is to predict what would have happened under different treatment options. We shall discuss this theoretical framework more thoroughly in Section 9.2. Causal interpretations of regression coefficients can only be justified by relying on much stricter assumptions than are needed for predictive inference. To motivate the detailed study of regression models for causal effects, we present two simple examples in which predictive comparisons do not yield appropriate causal inferences. Hypothetical example of zero causal effect but positive predictive comparison},

@article{Cornelius2005b,
abstract = {This paper evaluates the strategy for controlling ‘unwanted' immigration that has been implemented by the US government since 1993, and suggests explanations for the failure of that strategy to achieve its stated objectives thus far. Available evidence suggests that a strategy of immigration control that overwhelmingly emphasises border enforcement and short-changes interior (especially workplace) enforcement has caused illegal entries to be redistributed along the south-west border. The evidence also suggests that the financial cost of illegal entry has more than quadrupled; that undocumented migrants are staying longer in the United States; that migrant deaths resulting from clandestine border crossings have risen sharply; and that there has been a surge in anti-immigrant vigilante activity. Consequences predicted by advocates of the concentrated border enforcement strategy have not yet materialised: there is no evidence that unauthorised migration is being deterred at the point of origin; that would-be illegal entrants are being discouraged at the border after multiple apprehensions by the Border Patrol and returning home; that their employment prospects in the US have been curtailed; or that the resident population of undocumented immigrants is shrinking. It is argued that a severely constrained employer-sanctions enforcement effort that has left demand for unauthorised immigrant labour intact is the fundamental reason why steadily escalating spending on border enforcement during the last ten years has had such a weak deterrent effect. Reasons for the persistence of a failed immigration control policy are discussed, and alternatives to the current policy are evaluated.},

abstract = {Despite high rates of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the corresponding high mortality risk associated with risky sexual behavior, behavioral response has been limited. This paper explores three explanations for this: bias in OLS estimates, limited non-HIV life expectancy and limited knowledge. I find support for the first two. First, using a new instrumental variable strategy I find that OLS estimates of the relationship between risky sex and HIV are biased upwards, and IV estimates indicate reductions in risky behavior in response to the epidemic. Second, I find these reductions are larger for individuals who live in areas with higher life expectancy, suggesting high rates of non-HIV mortality suppress behavioral response; this is consistent with optimizing behavior. Using somewhat limited knowledge proxies, I find no evidence that areas with higher knowledge of the epidemic have greater behavior change.},

A new measure of chronic poverty is defined––as a high vulnerability to being poor––and compared with traditional interpretations of chronic poverty as low mean consumption. Households are highly vulnerable to falling into poverty even when their average consumption is some distance above the poverty line. The determinants of low mean consumption and high vulnerability appear however to be similar suggesting that policies to increase mean consumption will also reduce vulnerability.},

Due to preferential market access, however, additive regionalism is likely to provide Chile with gains that are many multiples of the static welfare gains from unilateral free trade. At least one partner country loses from each of the regional agreements considered, and excluded countries as a group always lose.

This article develops a multistage spatial model to determine optimal investment in transportation improvements, taking account of impacts on marketing costs and competition. The beneficial impact of investments from farmers' perspective is mainly through enhanced competition, meaning significant under-investment may occur if this effect is ignored. However, the optimal investment depends on the relative importance of transportation costs; in some settings, transportation improvements reduce farm prices because buyers rationally over-compensate farmers for these costs.},

abstract = {Vietnam is one of the major rice-producing countries in Asia, and since 1989 it has been a rice-exporting country. However, poor rice-farming households that depend primarily upon their own labor for farming face significant constraints on production that push members to migrate. Out-migration could have effects on agricultural production and household welfare. This study was conducted to draw correlations across migration, livelihoods, farming outcomes, and gender roles to derive gender-responsive policy recommendations for action in rice-producing villages of the Mekong Delta in the south and Red River Delta in the north. Results revealed that labor out-migration was highest in the rainfed villages in the south where the poor are located. Remittances comprised significant proportions of total household income, often more important than rice income, as was the case in the north. The effects of out-migration on family members left behind, particularly women, depend on the characteristics of the migrant, the duration of absence of the migrant, use of remittances, and women{\^{a}}€™s access to productive resources. The findings of this study have far-reaching implications for gender-responsive research and extension programs dealing with rice-based farming systems in Vietnam and other Asian countries that face labor shortages due to out-migration from rural areas.},

Since choices are often complex and made rapidly, they are typically affected by contextual variables that are thought to influence how much attention is paid to different attributes. I propose a modification of the attentional drift-diffusion model, the binary-attribute attentional drift diffusion model (baDDM), which describes the choice process over simple binary-attribute choices and how it is affected by fluctuations in visual attention. Using an eye-tracking experiment, I find the baDDM makes accurate quantitative predictions about several key variables including choices, reaction times, and how these variables are correlated with attention to two attributes in an accept-reject decision. Furthermore, I estimate an attribute-based fixation bias that suggests attention to an attribute increases its subjective weight by 5{\%}, while the unattended attribute's weight is decreased by 10{\%}.},

abstract = {Abstract  This paper considers the technical aspects and the consequences, in terms of simulation results and policy assessment, of introducing imperfect competition in a CGE model. The modifications to the standard CGE framework needed to model imperfect competition in some industries are briefly discussed. Next, the paper examines whether, how much and why, those changes may affect the qualitative output a typical simulation experiment. It is argued that technical choices made in designing the model structure may have a significant impact on the model behavior. This is especially evident when the model output of an imperfect competition closure is compared with the one of a standard closure, assuming perfect competition. As an illustration, a simulation of agricultural trade liberalization is analyzed. Results from the same simulation exercise, but produced by alternative model formulations (one standard competitive and three imperfect competition variants) are presented and discussed. It is found that having imperfect competition in a CGE model does matter in terms of simulation results. Furthermore, alternative formulations of imperfect competition typically bring about quite different findings and implications.},

Most empirical and theoretical analyses utilize multiplicative stochastic specifications which are analyzed and found unduly restrictive, particularly since inputs that marginally reduce risk are not allowed. A more general stochastic specification is proposed, free of these a priori restrictions. The proposed functional form estimation is discussed and demonstrated with nitrogen-response data and common log-linear production functions. Though nitrogen is risk-increasing, the marginal variance contribution is smaller when compared to estimates based upon multiplicative specification. Finally, stochastic specification error effects are analyzed.},

" We review various critiques of experimental program evaluation in developing countries, and discuss how experimenting at scale along three specific dimensions – the size of the sampling frame, the number of units treated, and the size of the unit of randomization – can help alleviate them. We find that program evaluation randomized controlled trials published in top journals over the last 15 years have typically been " small " in these senses, but also identify a number of examples – including from our own work – demonstrating that experimentation at much larger scales is both feasible and valuable.},

Country level data is used covering the years 1961-1996. Policy implications of reducing rural-urban migration using agricultural output elasticities are developed. The findings support the hypothesis that rural-urban migration is a positive function of the ratio of urban per capita income to rural per capita income. Moreover, the results support a policy aimed at reducing rural-urban migration flows through increases in per capita earnings derived from increased agricultural investment. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Two problems arise in the study of intermediate inputs: intermediate input decisions may be endogenous to final output, and intermediate inputs are likely to be correlated with each other and other variables, making identification and estimation difficult. The econometric model measures the productivity of intermediate inputs, taking into account the farmer's sequential input decisions and input productivity differences during the growing season. A multistage Cobb-Douglas model of wheat response to irrigation water is used to illustrate the proposed methods.},

Health Economics 3, 281–291) to measure the degree of income-related inequality in self-reported health in Canada by means of concentration indices. It finds that significant inequalities in self-reported ill-health exist and favour the higher income groups — the higher the level of income, the better the level of self-assessed health. The analysis also indicates that lower income individuals are somewhat more likely to report their self-assessed health as poor or less-than-good than higher income groups, at the same level of a more ‘objective' health indictor such as the McMaster Health Utility Index. The degree of inequality in ‘subjective' health is slightly higher than in ‘objective' health, but not significantly different. The degree of inequality in self-assessed health in Canada was found to be significantly higher than that reported by van Doorslaer et al. (1997, income related inequalities in health: some international comparisons, Journal of Health Economics 16, 93–112) for seven European countries, but not significantly different from the health inequality measured for the UK or the US. It also appears as if Canada's health inequality is higher than what would be expected on the basis of its income inequality.},

We consider two broad categories of PES programs, land-diversion programs, where lands are diverted from agriculture to other uses, and working-land programs, where agricultural production activities are modified to achieve environmental objectives. PES programs are generally good for landowners. The distribution of land and land quality is critical in determining poverty impacts. Where ES and agricultural productivity are negatively correlated and the poor own lands of low agricultural quality, they stand to gain from PES programs. Consumers and wage laborers may lose where food supply is inelastic and programs reduce labor demand. Working-land programs may have better distributional effects than diversion programs.},

Based on a primary survey of rural handloom clusters in Ethiopia, this article examines the mechanism and performance of clustering. Given weak financial institutions, clustered producers and traders use trade credits to ease working capital constraints. Moreover, geographical clustering enables entrepreneurs with limited capital to enter the business through shared workspaces and fine division of labour. An improvement in infrastructure can further enhance firm performance in a cluster. In towns with electricity access, producers work longer hours by sharing lit workspaces at lower rental cost.},

abstract = {Many governments in developing countries distribute fertilizer at subsidized prices in an effort to stimulate small farmers' agricultural productivity and food security. Prior fertilizer demand studies have largely failed to account for the effects of government programs on farmers' commercial purchases. Using a double hurdle model and nationally representative rural household panel data in Zambia, we distinguish between these sources and measure the contemporaneous "crowding in" and "crowding out" effects of government input programs on commercial fertilizer sales. Where the private sector is relatively active and average wealth is higher (areas seemingly more likely to be targeted by government programs), results indicate that subsidies have substantially crowded out the private sector, in some cases to the point that such programs could actually lower overall fertilizer use. On the other hand, in poorer areas where the private sector is relatively inactive, subsidies help to generate demand and crowd in private sector retailers. Empirical studies explicitly modeling farmers' fertilizer purchase behavior within a dual marketing framework can provide important insights for agricultural policy discussions in developing countries.},

abstract = {Children are notoriously bad at delaying gratification to achieve later, greater rewards (e.g., Piaget, 1970)-and some are worse at waiting than others. Individual differences in the ability-to-wait have been attributed to self-control, in part because of evidence that long-delayers are more successful in later life (e.g., Shoda, Mischel, {\&} Peake, 1990). Here we provide evidence that, in addition to self-control, children's wait-times are modulated by an implicit, rational decision-making process that considers environmental reliability. We tested children (M= 4;6, N= 28) using a classic paradigm-the marshmallow task (Mischel, 1974)-in an environment demonstrated to be either unreliable or reliable. Children in the reliable condition waited significantly longer than those in the unreliable condition (p{\textless} 0.0005), suggesting that children's wait-times reflected reasoned beliefs about whether waiting would ultimately pay off. Thus, wait-times on sustained delay-of-gratification tasks (e.g., the marshmallow task) may not only reflect differences in self-control abilities, but also beliefs about the stability of the world. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we simulate the long-run effects of migrant flows on wages of high-skilled and low-skilled non-migrants in a set of countries using an aggregate model of national economies. New in this literature we calculate the wage effect of emigration as well as immigration. We focus on Europe and compare the outcomes for large Western European countries with those of other key destination countries both in the OECD and outside the OECD. Our analysis builds on an improved database of bilateral stocks and net migration flows of immigrants and emigrants by education level for the years 1990 through 2000. We find that all European countries experienced a decrease in their average wages and a worsening of their wage inequality because of emigration. Whereas, contrary to the popular belief, immigration had nearly equal but opposite effects: positive on average wages and reducing wage inequality of non-movers. These patterns hold true using a range of parameters for our simulations, accounting for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, and correcting for the quality of schooling and/or labor-market downgrading of skills. In terms of wage outcomes, it follows that prevalent public fears in European countries are misplaced; immigration has had a positive average wage effect on native workers. Some concerns should be focused on the wage effect of emigration, instead.},

The new subsidy paradigm however does not address how to curtail political manipulation which exacerbated inefficiencies of previous programs. This paper analyzes whether politics affected voucher allocations in Ghana's 2008 fertilizer subsidy program. We find that more vouchers were targeted to districts that the ruling party had lost in the previous presidential elections and more so in districts that had been lost by a higher percentage margin. This evidence shows that a significant threat to the efficiency of fertilizer subsidies remains.},

Specifically, the report analyzes the different sources of income for rural households, as well as their socioeconomic characteristics, with a view to identifying potential pathways to improving incomes, especially for poor households, and stimulating inclusive rural growth. The overall picture that emerges is one of an economy heavily dependent on services for local employment and on international migration for income. Like a two-legged stool, such an economy is potentially unstable in the face of external shocks. Diversification of the Mon State economy, including diversification and increased productivity within the agricultural sector, will lessen the relative dependence on external migration remittances and result in more resilient growth in the future},

@article{Ronnback2003,
abstract = {There are many environmental and socio-economic concerns about the shrimp aquaculture industry. This study, based on interviews, direct observations and literature reviews, shows that the Indian hatchery industry is heavily dependent upon the continuous support of natural resources and ecosystem services generated by marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The mangrove ecosystem support area ('ecological footprint') needed to supply the hatcheries with Penaeus monodon shrimp broodstock, and the aquaculture grow-out ponds with postlarvae, exemplify the dependence on external ecosystems. Each hectare of mangrove in the Godavari River delta generated an annual fisheries catch of 0.8-1.5 P. monodon spawners (gravid females), valued at US{\$} 92-184. The entire Godavari mangrove delta had a partial gross economic value of US{\$} 3.0-6.0 million per year for the provision of shrimp spawners alone. The average hatchery, producing 75 million postlarvae annually, had an ecological footprint of 534 ha mangrove for the life-support input of shrimp spawners. The ecological footprint of intensive shrimp ponds was up to 11 times the pond area for postlarval input alone. The shrimp ponds in the State of Andhra Pradesh needed 35000-138000 ha of mangroves to satisfy the spawner requirement to hatcheries, and this implied a need to appropriate mangroves in other regions. Hatcheries were prepared to pay up to US{\$} 2000 for a single shrimp spawner, which also illustrated that the mangrove support areas regionally available were too small. Other concerns about the industry are the net loss of employment if hatcheries replace wild postlarvae collection, the extensive use of groundwater creating direct resource-use conflicts, by-catch problems in broodstock fisheries, and pollution by effluents. The risk of hatcheries introducing, amplifying and propagating disease affecting both cultured organisms and wild biota is another concern that can, and should, be addressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In 2002, China launched the largest public health insurance scheme in the world, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). It is intended to enable rural populations to access health care services, and to curb medical impoverishment. Whether the scheme can reach its equity goals depends on how it is used, and by whom. Our goal is to shed light on whether and how income levels affect the ability of members to reap insurance benefits.METHODS:We exploit primary panel data consisting of a complete census (over 3500 individuals) in three villages in Puding County, Guizhou province, collected in 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011. Data was collected during in-person interviews with household member(s). The data include yearly gross and net medical expenses for all individuals, and socio-economic information. We apply probit, ordinary least squares, and tobit multivariate regression analyses to the three waves in which NCMS was active (2006, 2009 and 2011). Explained variables include obtainment, levels and rates of NCMS reimbursement. Household income is the main explanatory variable, with household- and individual-level controls. We restrict samples to rule out self-selection, and exploit the 2009 NCMS reform to highlight equity-enhancing features of insurance.RESULTS:Prior to 2009 reforms, higher income in our sample was statistically significantly related to higher probability of obtaining reimbursement, as well as higher levels and rates of reimbursement. These relations all disappear after the reform, suggesting lower-income households were better able to reap insurance benefits after the scheme was reformed. Regression results suggest this is partly explained by reimbursement for chronic diseases.CONCLUSIONS:The post-reform NCMS distributed benefits more equitably in our study area. Making health insurance pro-poor may require a focus on outpatient costs, credit constraints and chronic diseases, rather than catastrophic illnesses.},

These shocks to food production can mire farming households in poverty traps. This study investigates whether unconditional cash transfers can help households cope with agricultural production and price shocks. We find that cash empowers poor, rural households facing these negative shocks to employ coping strategies typically used by the non-poor and enables them to substantially increase their food consumption and overall food security. Extending relatively small cash payments unconditionally to the rural poor is a powerful policy option for fostering climate-resilient development.},

abstract = {The paper develops a general, "collective" model of household labor supply in which agents are characterized by their own (possibly altruistic) preferences, and household decisions are only assumed to be Pareto efficient. An alternative interpretation is that there are two stages in the internal decision process: agents first share nonlabor income, according to some given sharing rule; then each one optimally chooses his or her own labor supply and consumption. This setting is shown to generate testable restrictions on labor supplies. Moreover, the observation of labor supply behavior is sufficient for recovering individual preferences and the sharing rule (up to a constant). Finally, the traditional tools of welfare analysis can be adapted to the new setting.},

abstract = {Purpose - The objectives of this paper are to: examine e-shopping quality dimensions; explore how e-shopping quality factors influence consumer shopping outcomes (e-shopping satisfaction and e-shopping intention); and test the moderating effects of consumer experiential e-shopping motives on the e-shopping quality - e-shopping outcomes links within the context of online apparel retailing. Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered from 298 college students in the USA using a self-administered online survey. Findings - Among four e-shopping quality factors identified (privacy/security, web site content/functionality, customer service, and experiential/atmospheric), web site content/functionality and atmospheric/experiential quality have significant impact on e-shopping satisfaction contributing to e-shopping intention, while privacy/security and customer service have significant impact on e-shopping intention but not on e-shopping satisfaction. Furthermore, this study provides some support for the moderating roles that experiential e-shopping motives plays in the e-shopping quality - e-shopping outcomes links. Research limitation/implications - This paper shows that experiential e-shopping motives as an individual characteristic play a role in controlling the dynamics among e-shopping quality, e-shopping satisfaction, and e-shopping intention. However, the data consisting of self-reported measures from a single segment of online retail industry warrants caution in generalization in relation to common method bias. Practical implications - This paper entails useful implications for internet- and multichannel retail marketers delivering apparel/fashion goods to better understand the online consumer response process and determine effective e-store management strategies that reflect the differing customer evaluation processes. Originality/value - This study extends and complements the e-tail service literature by examining whether and how experiential e-shopping motives moderate the relationships among e-shopping quality dimensions, e-shopping satisfaction, and e-shopping intention.},

The key finding is that households move frequently in and out of poverty but the difficulty of exiting from poverty, like the chance of avoiding slipping back, increases with the time spent in that state and varies considerably between male- and female-headed households. Our results imply that it is important to design anti-poverty policies both to hinder households from slipping into extreme poverty and to minimize the length of the poverty spell for households once they have fallen into it.},

abstract = {With economic progress, it was expected that smallholders would fade into history. This has been the experience in much of the global North and it was expected to occur as development proceeded in the global South. In East and Southeast Asia, however, smallholders have persisted in the face of rapid and profound social and economic transformation. This presents the core puzzle that the paper addresses: why has the farm-size transition not occurred in much of East and Southeast Asia? Why have smallholders stubbornly resisted the tide of economic history? The first half of the paper defines the smallholder and smallholding, sets out the historical evolution of smallholdings in the region, and explores the role of smallholders in national development. The second half of the paper explains the persistence of the smallholder through three explanatory lenses: the economics of smallholder farming; the role of farm policy; and the logics of smallholder-based livelihoods in a context of global integration. The paper concludes by setting out four possible rural futures for the wider East Asian countryside and smallholder.},

abstract = {Over 5 years of participatory on-farm research, market access, profitability, farming systems productivity and economic sustainability were compared on 100 small-scale farms in Central Cameroon. Integration technology based on the use of agricultural by-products as fishpond inputs was the driver for intensification. Over all farms, fishpond productivity increased from 498. kg to 1609. kg fish/ha (2145. kg/ha/yr). During the project period, the number of active fish farmers increased from 15 to 192 (including 55 farms which participated only through information exchange). Over all farms, net returns from aquaculture increased by 5 times over pre-project levels. Productivity, intensity and profitability increased more significantly in periurban areas with good market access, compared to rural areas. Among farmers with good market access, average net income from the aquaculture enterprise rose from {\$}118 up to {\$}1485. Research-Extension Team (RET) support cost an average of {\$}61,300 per year. Over 5 years, rural farmers recaptured 23{\%} of the relevant RET investment compared to 442{\%} by periurban farmers. Likewise, increase in production attributable to RET intervention was higher for periurban (253{\%}) compared to rural (11.3{\%}) fish farmers. Within 3 years of the end of extension support, rural farmers had returned to pre-project production levels, whereas periurban farms had better maintained their productivity and profitability. Findings indicate that, in areas with little or no access to markets, the number of fishponds and fish farmers can be increased and yields improved, increasing local food supplies, but sustainability in the absence of extension subsidies is questionable. To achieve either of the two principal goals for the sector, food security and/or poverty alleviation, investments need to be made in improving the availability of quality technical assistance to targeted farmers and finding means of reducing social conflict arising from perceived inequalities in the accrual of the benefits of development. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We use panel data methods to explore whether households in Vietnam used seasonal migration to increase their living standards during the 1990s. Using per capita expenditures as our primary measure of living standards and historical and latent network variables as instruments for migration, we can attribute 5.2 percentage points of annualized expenditure growth to increased migration. The results are robust to several alternative measures of living standards. As the estimates suggest migration accounts for a 3 percentage point decrease in the poverty headcount, we conclude migration played an important role in the improvement of living standards observed in Vietnam.

Subjective rates of time preference, identified from estimation of consumption Euler equations, are three to five percentage points higher for households with low permanent incomes than for those with high permanent incomes. Controlling for race and education widens this difference. With age and family composition held constant, time preference rates vary from 12 percent for white, college-educated families in the top 5 percent of the labor income distribution to 19 percent for nonwhite families without a college education whose labor incomes are in the bottom fifth percentile. Such differences imply very different patterns of consumption over the life cycle and suggest one possible explanation for observed heterogeneity in savings behavior across socioeconomic classes.

Innovation diffusion theory was used to guide the research. Eight hundred seventy-nine rural consumers from 11 states completed surveys twice (in 2000 and 2003). Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and analyses of variance. Dissatisfaction with local retailing in 2000 was a powerful driver of outshopping, beliefs about online shopping, and online shopping (both in 2000 and in 2003). Outshopping was positively related to online shopping at both points in time, suggesting that variables found to affect outshopping in the literature may affect online shopping in a similar way. },

In this study, we investigated the factors affecting better knowledge and greater risk perception about earthquakes among residents of Istanbul. A field survey was carried out, and a total of 1,123 people were interviewed in two districts of Istanbul with different seismic risk levels and from three (low, moderate and high) socio-economic levels (SEL). The findings showed that although the level of knowledge regarding earthquakes and preparedness for them was promising, it could be improved. The results indicated that future preparedness programmes should target people with lower educational and socio-economic levels. The media were the leading source of information among the respondents. Location of the home was a strong influence on individuals having above average earthquake knowledge and even more on high risk perception. Socio-economic parameters (educational level, economic status, SEL of the sub-district and tenure of the home), gender and attitude score were other factors influencing greater risk perception with regard to earthquakes},

markets is well developed, there is a striking gap with regards to
the impact of emigration on sending countries. Building on the established
literature measuring the impact of immigration, this paper attempts
to narrow that gap by investigating whether the short but intense
emigration period from Honduras from 2001 to 2007 to the U.S. increased
wages in Honduras. It notably exploits the variation of labour supply
by skill group in the labour market in the years following Hurricane
Mitch. Relying on individual cross-sectional data and an instrumental
variable approach, the estimates show that a 10{\%} increase in emigration
from Honduras increased wages in Honduras by around 10{\%}, an increase
which is higher than previous findings in other countries ? but diminishing
over time. It also provides evidence on implications in terms of
redistribution by gender, rural/urban households and private sector
workers.},

abstract = {This paper first reviews the debate on the definition of pro-poor growth and argues that a relative definition has merits when defining the state of pro-poor growth, while an absolute definition is most suitable when analyzing the rate of pro-poor growth. The second contribution is to extend the pro-poor growth toolbox to non-income indicators. The analysis, applied to Bolivia, shows that this extension greatly improves our understanding of the distribution of change in non-income indicators, of the linkages between progress in income and non-income dimensions of poverty, and on the incidence of progress in non-income outcomes along the income distribution.},

@article{Filipski2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The rapid growth of fish farming over the past three decades has generated heated debate over the role of aquaculture in rural development and poverty reduction. Central to these debates is the question of whether and how aquaculture impacts local incomes and employment, yet little empirical evidence exists on the issue. To address this question, we propose a Local Economy-wide Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) model which nests fish farm models within a general-equilibrium model of their local economy. The model is calibrated using primary data collected from 1102 households in Myanmar's main aquaculture zone, representative of 60{\%} of the country's aquaculture farms. Using this model, we examine the impact of aquaculture on the incomes and labor market outcomes of fish farming households, but also crop farms and non-farm households in the cluster. Simulating one-acre increases in pond/plot surface we find that: (1) aquaculture generates much higher incomes per-acre than agriculture; (2) aquaculture generates larger income spillovers than agriculture for non-farm households by way of retail and labor markets; (3) small commercial fish farms generate greater spillovers than large fish farms. These results bolster the notion that fish-farming, and in particular small-scale commercial aquaculture, may have a significant role to play in rural development and poverty reduction.},

This year's report takes a special look at how food systems can best contribute to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on rigorous research, IFPRI researchers and other distinguished food policy experts consider a wide range of crucial questions:$\backslash$nHow can we support the critical contributions of smallholders to food security in a world facing climate change?$\backslash$nWhat are the causes and costs of food loss and waste within food systems, and how can this loss be reduced?$\backslash$nHow can sound management of water resources provide multiple benefits for health, nutrition, and sustainability?$\backslash$nWhat policy choices can best promote sustainable management of agricultural land and soil resources and the ecosystem services they provide?$\backslash$nWhere are the most promising opportunities for exploiting synergies between green energy and food security goals?$\backslash$nWhat changes in global diets can make the greatest contribution to food security and sustainability?$\backslash$nHow can we use food value chains to develop effective interventions to achieve both better nutrition and sustainability?$\backslash$nThe 2016 Global Food Policy Report also presents data for several key food policy indicators, including country-level data on hunger, agricultural spending, agricultural research investment, and capacity for food policy research. In addition to illustrative figures, tables, and a timeline of food policy events in 2015, the report also presents the results of a global opinion poll on the current state of food policy.},

It also investigates the determinants that affect wages of both migrant and non-migrant workers in order to evaluate how economic and social-demographic factors contribute to the earning gap between rural and urban workers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas, ITQs, in fisheries are analogous to transferable pollution permits in environmental policy. However, they are different in that the right to produce is for the final product, the fish, whereas pollution permits are for a non-market joint product (i.e., sulfur dioxide) of the good produced for sale. In both cases, the actual economic efficiency effects of creating the property rights depend upon the workings of the market for both the final product and the rights. There has been considerable work on market failures for pollution permits, and this paper extends the analysis to ITQs. It is shown that the difference between pollution permits and ITQs can change the type and occurrence of failure in the market for the final product, but it does not affect the potential for failure in the market for permits.},

Under our preferred assumption that world demand for traditional exports is highly price elastic, the abolition of controls raised welfare, but only by a small amount because traditional exports were small relative to GDP. If, alternatively, the price elasticity of world demand for jute is as low as some econometric estimates suggest, the abolition of controls slightly reduced welfare, by removing an approximation to an optimal export tax.},

The paradox of on-farm labor shortages on small landholdings can be explained by the multiple constraints smallholders face. These multiple constraints, including lack of finance, concerns for food security, and others, lead to suboptimal allocations of household resources. In turn, the low returns to labor and land, contribute to household food insecurity and a vicious cycle of poverty. The findings of the paper provide a clear signal to policymakers and research and extension institutions that these constraints are all linked, and addressing one cannot be effective without addressing the others.},

Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the leading causes of both death and the burden of disease, and exposure to risk factors is high: more than 300 million men smoke cigarettes and 160 million adults are hypertensive, most of whom are not being treated. An obesity epidemic is imminent, with more than 20{\%} of children aged 7-17 years in big cities now overweight or obese. The government of the People's Republic of China must confront these major challenges. The national cancer prevention and control plan (2004-10) is being implemented, and a national chronic disease prevention and control plan is due to be completed this year. Encouraging progress has been made in some areas, with current smoking prevalence in men declining at about 1{\%} per year for a decade, and even better results in large demonstration programmes. Much remains to be done, and resources and sustainability are major issues. However, the surveillance and intervention mechanisms needed to ameliorate the increasing burden of chronic diseases are developing rapidly, taking account of the lessons learned over the past two decades.},

We use a 28-sector, three-country computable general equilibrium (CGE) model in which we explicitly model agricultural and food policies in both countries, and differentiate land types. Agricultural policies include tariffs, quotas, input subsidies to farm and food processing sectors, targeted producer prices, fixed retail food prices and deficiency payments. Subsidies to Mexico's food processing industries and deficiency payments are endogenous, rather than fixed, ad valorem price wedges. We use the model to explore the effects of full and partial liberalization of agriculture in an FTA, a restructuring of Mexican domestic farm policies in conjunction with an FTA, and the effects of an increase in the Mexican capital stock. We find that there is potential for Mexican farm program changes to assist agriculture's transition to a free trade environment, and that in the long term, increased capital investment will enable Mexican agriculture to benefit from free trade.},

In addition, low fertility rates in neighboring East Asian countries (regions) ignite more concern. We find that the urban fertility rate is strongly correlated with housing prices. Particularly, the fertility rate is higher in cities where housing is more spacious or housing price is cheaper.

@techreport{WorldBank2016a,
abstract = {This report was prepared by the World Bank in partnership with the Livelihoods and Food Security Multi-Donor Trust Fund (LIFT). Both the World Bank and the LIFT are actively involved in supporting Myanmar's agriculture sector given its significance in poverty reduction and food security, and they both consider the lack of reliable farm data to be a significant constraint to designing effective programs and policies. This report fills some of the data gaps. In addition to presenting the collected data, the report offers the first analysis of these data. It focuses on the assessment of the extent of crop diversification and an analysis of farm production economics, in particular (partial factor) productivity of agricultural land and labor and crop profitability. This focus was chosen to study Myanmar's commercial production areas and to facilitate international comparisons, as most international studies follow a similar approach, focusing on advanced farmers in commercial production areas. The four main findings of the report are as follows: (i) Myanmar's farming systems are diversified and during the monsoon season most farms produce paddy, during the cool and dry seasons most farms produce crops other than paddy, mainly beans and pulses, oilseeds, and maize; (ii) the analysis reconfirmed that agricultural productivity in Myanmar is low, irrespective of what indicators are used, limiting the sector's contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity; (iii) low productivity is a result of multiple factors, many of them associated with the undersupply of quality public services such as research, extension, and rural infrastructure, in delivery of which the government has a key role to play; and (iv) going forward and given that paddy is less profitable and more costly to produce than other crops in most agro-ecological zones, especially during the cool and dry seasons, it is desirable to redesign public programs from exclusive support of paddy production to support for broad-based agricultural development.},

abstract = {The validity of producer and consumer surplus measures of firm welfare under risk is examined. Under constant absolute risk aversion and output price uncertainty only, these measures are an exact measure of firm welfare as defined by compensating variation, equivalent variation or the change in the certainty equivalent. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, qualitative comparisons of various measures are discussed. For example, producer's surplus as measured by the area above the uncompensated risk averse supply curve overstates the compensating variation of a change in expected price of output. Procedures for calculating firm welfare under production uncertainty and a variety of economic environments are proposed. Generally, these procedures are applicable only when absolute risk aversion is constant.},

abstract = {The overall goal of our paper is to understand the impact that irrigation in China has had on grain production and incomes, in general, and income and poverty alleviation in poor areas, in particular. The paper seeks to meet three objectives. First, we describe the relationship among irrigation status, yields and household crop revenue. Second, we seek to understand the magnitude and nature of the effect that irrigation has on yields and crop revenue. Finally, we seek to understand the impact that irrigation has on incomes in poor areas. Our analysis shows that irrigation contributes to increases in yields for almost all crops and in income for farmers in all areas. The importance of crop income in poor areas and the strong relationship between crop revenue and irrigation provides evidence of the importance of irrigation in past and future poverty alleviation in China. We also show that in the majority of the villages that invested in new irrigation, returns are positive even after accounting for increases in capital and production costs.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Available online xxxx Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agricul-ture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean grow-ing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km 2 with a standard error of 23,000 km 2 . This result is 1.0{\%} lower than USDA's 2015 June survey estimate and 1.9{\%} higher than USDA's 2016 January estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2 months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84{\%}. The field-based sample estimat-ed area was then used to calibrate the map such that the soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the sample-based area estimate. The strength of the sample-based area estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The suc-cess of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially other crops in an operational mode.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to describe current chemical use practices in the aquaculture sector of Bangladesh and to identify the factors that influence them. A survey on the use of chemical and biological products was conducted between November 2011 and June 2012 using structured questionnaires administered to operators of nine farm groups, including homestead ponds, carps, tilapias, koi fish, shrimps, shrimps and prawns, prawns, rice and fish, and pangas. Farm type and farm owner characteristics were used as independent variables to explain observed chemical use. Forty-six chemical and biological products (7 water and sediment treatment compounds, 13 disinfectants, 7 antibiotics, 7 pesticides, 8 fertilizers and 4 feed additives and probiotics) were reported to be applied in aquaculture. The use of disinfectants and antibiotics was found to be highest in intensive koi and pangas farms as compared to other farm groups, whereas the use of fertilizers was lowest in these farm groups. A higher percentage of prawn and shrimp/prawn farmers applied pesticides than other farm groups. A multivariate analysis showed that patterns of use of chemical and biological products were significantly different across aquaculture farm groups, with the largest number of chemical compounds used by the intensive koi farm group. The study shows that, despite rapid expansion of commercial aquaculture in Bangladesh, use of chemical and biological products is still relatively low compared to other aquaculture producing countries in Asia. However, despite this finding, the study identified a large number of compounds that are currently in use, and that require further regulation and evaluation regarding their potential environmental and human health impacts, as already done in most developed countries. Statement of relevance: Chemical use practices in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Summary This paper applies a conceptual framework of "governance failure" to an analysis of the institutional dimensions of urban water supply provision to poor households, focusing on the case of Jakarta. Data from a household survey, archives, GIS-based mapping, and interviews are used to document governance failures that create disincentives for utilities to connect poor households and for poor households to connect. The paper concludes by suggesting that the debate over the relative merits of public and private provision has diverted attention from the pressing issue of governance reform, and by raising the question of whether household provision of networked water supply by monopolistic providers (whether public or private) is universally feasible given the current water supply policy norms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd Access to international markets provides smallholders with unprecedented opportunities, but also exposes them to world market whims. We use a local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) model to analyze how the recent global saffron-price variability affected Morocco's Taliouine–Taznakht region, a specialized agro-export economy with a stark gender division of labor. Prices of saffron increased by 71{\%} per year over the 2007–09 period before falling quickly back to their trend. Our modeling approach allows us to simulate such shocks and evaluate impacts not only on producers but also on the local economies around them. In our simulations, positive price-shocks and increases in productivity both cause large reallocations of labor resources, particularly for female workers at harvest time. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate how saffron-price variance affects the economy. Female wage income is especially sensitive to global price variability: a 100{\%} increase in saffron-price variance leads to 133{\%} increase in female wage income variance, but only 36{\%} for males. Accounting for general-equilibrium effects is critical for understanding the ramifications of exposure to export price volatility in poor economies.},

abstract = {In this paper we use the logic of contractual relationships within the family to explore how technological change, distributional struggle, and collective action can help explain the relationship between economic development, fertility decline, and the emergence of more egalitarian marriages. We draw on the historical context of Great Britain and the U.S. between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries to argue that the property rights afforded male household heads constituted a system of residual claimancy not unlike modern contractual relationships within the capitalist firm. Based upon these patriarchal property rights, we present a simple model of household decisions to allocate women's labor between productive and reproductive activities, comparing the outcomes of egalitarian and patriarchal governance and concluding that patriarchal governance may create incentives for men to force women to "overspecialize" in reproductive labor.},

abstract = {This paper examines ethnic diversity and local public goods in rural western Kenya. The identification strategy relies on the stable historically determined patterns of ethnic land settlement. Ethnic diversity is associated with lower primary school funding and worse school facilities, and there is suggestive evidence that it leads to poor water well maintenance. The theoretical model illustrates how inability to impose social sanctions in diverse communities leads to collective action failures, and we find that school committees in diverse areas do impose fewer sanctions on defaulting parents. We relate these results to the literature on social capital and economic development and discuss implications for decentralization in less developed countries. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over the past decade, economic and agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has resumed. The secular downward trend in agricultural prices ended in the early 1990s; growing incomes in Asia and Africa, combined with continued rapid population growth, are fueling food demand, which is expected to lead to a gradual upward trend in international real agricultural prices. For Africa the major agricultural growth opportunities will be in regional and domestic markets for food staples. To seize these opportunities, SSA will have to support economic growth via continued sound macroeconomic policies, further improvements in the investment climate, and investments in infrastructure and institutions. In the agricultural sector SSA will have to (1) remove the remaining agricultural taxation that still disadvantages African farmers relative to all other farmers in the world, (2) improve its services for small farmers, (3) significantly increase its investment in agricultural technology generation and dissemination at national and subregional levels, (4) empower local governments, communities, and farmer organizations for their own development via further administrative and fiscal decentralization and community-driven development, and (5) strengthen the already existing regional agricultural institutions for agricultural trade, biosafety, phytosanitary regulations, seed production, regulation and trade, and technology generation.},

Rural areas accounted for the bulk of the gains to the poor, though migration to urban areas helped. Rural economic growth was far more important to national poverty reduction than urban economic growth; agriculture played a far more important role than the secondary or tertiary sources of GDP. Taxation of farmers and inflation hurt the poor; local government spending helped them in absolute terms; external trade had little short-term impact. Provinces starting with relatively high inequality saw slower progress against poverty, due both to lower growth and a lower growth elasticity of poverty reduction.},

Per capita consumption has decreased for the households during this time. The decrease has not been dramatic, but it has occurred at all points along the distribution. Over the two-year period, the number of households who have fallen into poverty is over twice as large as the number of households who have climbed out of poverty. About two-thirds of overall poverty is chronic (average consumption over time is below the poverty line), and almost half of all poor are always poor. We use quantile regression methods to identify the factors that explain total, chronic, and transitory poverty. While our analysis is able to document the extent of transitory poverty, it performs relatively poorly in explaining the determinants of this type of poverty. The predominantly chronic nature of poverty in our sample, and our ability to identify associated characteristics, strengthens the case for targeting antipoverty interventions, such as food subsidies. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The original aim of these interviews was to elicit information about effects of the disaster on various social institutions and the need for capacity building in relation to reconstruction. Through the interview process, however, a strong theme relating to coping, at both the individual and community level, began to emerge, and an expanded interview protocol based on the methodologies of resilience (see Hall and Zautra, 2010) was developed and used to build the conceptualization of disaster described here. Material from the interviews was supplemented by a systematic search of print and new media to form a picture of public discourse following the tsunami.},

abstract = {We have performed a screen combining subtractive hybridization with PCR to isolate genes that are regulated when neuroepithelial (NE) cells differentiate into neurons. From this screen, we have isolated a number of known genes that have not previously been associated with neurogenesis, together with several novel genes. Here we report that one of these genes, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is regulated during the differentiation of distinct neuronal populations. We have cloned both rat and mouse GEF genes and shown that they are orthologs of the human gene, MR-GEF, which encodes a GEF that specifically activates the small GTPase, Rap1. We have therefore named the rat gene rat mr-gef (rmr-gef) and the mouse gene mouse mr-gef (mmr-gef). Here, we will collectively refer to these two rodent genes as mr-gef. Expression studies show that mr-gef is expressed by young neurons of the developing rodent CNS but not by progenitor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ). The expression pattern of mr-gef during early telencephalic neurogenesis is strikingly similar to that of GABA and the LIM homeobox gene Lhx6, a transcription factor expressed by GABAergic interneurons generated in the ventral telencephalon, some of which migrate into the cortex during development. These observations suggest that mr-gef encodes a protein that is part of a signaling pathway involved in telencephalic neurogenesis; particularly in the development of GABAergic interneurons.},

Cooperative selling institutions are potential catalysts for mitigating these costs, stimulating entry into the market, and promoting growth in rural communities. Trends in cooperative organization in east-African dairy are evaluated. Empirical work focuses on alternative techniques for effecting participation among a representative sample of peri-urban milk producers in the Ethiopian highlands. The variables considered are a modern production practice (cross-bred cow use), a traditional production practice (indigenous-cow use), three intellectual-capital-forming variables (experience, education, and extension), and the provision of infrastructure (as measured by time to transport milk to market). A Tobit analysis of marketable surplus generates precise estimates of non-participants' 'distances' to market and their reservation levels of the covariates 2014 measures of the inputs necessary to sustain and enhance the market. Policy implications focus on the availability of cross-bred stock and the level of market infrastructure, both of which have marked effects on participation, the velocity of transactions in the local community and, inevitably, the social returns to agroindustrialization.},

abstract = {Most resource management studies model the resource in isolation from the rest of the economy of which it is part. In many developing economies, agents participate in multiple activities, creating linkages between resource exploitation and other sectors (e.g., agriculture). In Northern Honduran fishing communities, households allocate effort to fishing according to the opportunity cost of their time, which depends on returns in other activities. We develop a model that demonstrates how market structure impacts fishery exploitation. Agricultural price increases have an ambiguous effect on labor allocated to fishing because they reduce the value of labor in fishing but increase the demand for fish via an income effect. The size and magnitude of impacts depend strongly on the tradability of inputs and outputs in the community economy. The findings point to a need to account for economic linkages and market structure when designing policies to reduce pressure on a natural resource.},

@article{Harris2001,
abstract = {For many years now, farmers have been criticised for their methods of production. It is popularly believed that the intensive use of chemicals, in particular, can lead to a degree of environmental pollution too great to ignore. The recent crises in animal husbandry have done nothing to take the sting out of this criticism, An improvement in agricultural policy is being demanded which would bring farming closer to nature, and provide for improvements in animal welfare and consumer-orientation. The Federal Government aims to intensify its promotion of ecological farming, ra ising the question of how this will affect the conventional farmers, who are still farming over 90 {\%} of our arable land today. A number of surveys in recent years have shown that the majority of conventional farmers try their best to keep the interests of environmental protection in view. In this article, too, where we are addressing the subject of pesticide management, such efforts on the part of farmers are plain for all to see. For this survey, 74 farmers (mainly from full-time cash-crop farms) were selected from 73 parishes evenly spread over the State of Baden-Wurttemberg. All the respondent farmers held the necessary technical qualifications (certificate of technical competence) and possessed field-crop sprayers with valid inspection plates. In the way of a check, 73 {\%} of the respondents arranged for a "spraying window", and 4/5 kept plot records of the measures they had taken to protect their plants. All this shows that farmers are able to manage their pesticides in a manner compatible with the environment. It is also clear that farmers adopt differentiated strategies for their pesticide management, acting prophylactically after the first signs of infestation, and in accordance with damage-threshold principles. None of these strategies predominates. The results of the survey clearly reveal what farmers believe is delaying the application of the damage-threshold principle to pesticide management. The survey suggests that the "conventional" farmers interviewed are well on the way to developing sound practical methods, and that they have therefore earned the same support as their "ecological" colleagues.},

@misc{Leider2014,
abstract = {Rohingya The name. The movement. The quest for identity. For quite a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth century, ethnicity was defined by cultural and racial criteria supported by the underlying assumption that cultural characteristics were markers of a fixed identity. People could thus be divided and subdivided into essentialized ethnic categories. It is this " culturalist " and racial understanding of ethnic identity, read back into history and widely spread in Myanmar, that has led to the formulation of the so-called list of 135 ethnic groups, a list that reflects political choices based on ethnic, cultural and historical criteria. These groups are hierarchized and co-exist in a multi-layered context that is determined by historical precursors, socio-economic environments and changing political conditions. Some are arguably more dominant and prominent than others. In Myanmar the constitutionally defined ethnic categories are often said to derive from the colonial state. But one may as well trace the concept of such categories back to various lists of 101 peoples found in precolonial Myanmar, Rakhine and Mon texts. 1 While ethnicity is a rigid concept that dominates political and social relations in Myanmar, contemporary scholarship would not support the inflexibility of such categories, because it rejects the " reification of ethnic distinctions " and the " obscuring " of processes of ethnic change. 2 Anthropological research tells us that ethnic identity is not intrinsically given and fixed, but subject to change as much as society as a whole is nowhere fitting a once-for-all model. Identities undergo transformation, as people migrate and adapt to new places, to socio-economic change and to cultural challenges. The close observation and analysis of such changes is precisely one of the objects of social studies in general and historians, in particular, have been interested in identities that fade and new collective identities that take shape. Collective self-awareness and cultural markers form the visible and vocal parts of novel identities, but it is the creation of new political borders (or state-building) and the emergence of divisive political projects that appear, at hindsight, as the key determinant factors. When the formation of identities is analyzed, the deeply political nature of this process cannot escape our attention. Identity, in the view of modern scholars, is not merely a naturally given, but it is very much written into a collective, open-ended historical experience, both construed and fluid. This does not mean though that newly emergent identities will automatically take hold, go socially and legally uncontested and obtain recognition. The issue can be highly controversial. When social scientists focus, for example, on the building of a collective national identity in the State of Singapore, a relatively new country, or the issue of recognition of the Palestinians as a nation, they face such highly complex, historically individualized and eventually contested contexts.},

In the paper we seek to assess some of the strengths and weaknesses of the program using a panel of national-representative, household survey data that were collected in 2005 and early 2008. According to our data, we confirm the recent reports by the Ministry of Health that there have been substantial improvements to the NCMS program in terms of coverage and participation. We also show that rural individuals also perceive an improvement in service by 2007. While the progress of the NCMS program is clear, there are still weaknesses. Most importantly, the program clearly does not meet one of its key goals of providing insurance against catastrophic illnesses. On average, individuals that required inpatient treatment in 2007 were reimbursed for 15{\%} of their expenditures. Although this is higher than in 2004, on average, as the severity of the illness (in terms of expenditures on health care) rose, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount/total expenditure on medical care) fell. The real reimbursement rate for illnesses that required expenditures between 4000 and 10,000 yuan (over 10,000 yuan) was only 11{\%} (8{\%}). Our analysis shows that one of the limiting factors is constrained funding.},

Its focus on poverty duration and dynamics highlights the forms of social relations that produce poverty, and which are often embedded within political institutions and economic structures. Poverty reduction does not simply require “good” policy: it requires creating the capacity of poorer people to influence, and hold accountable, those who make policies.},

abstract = {Na-K-ATPase and H-K-ATPase are highly homologous ion pumps that exhibit distinct plasma membrane distributions in epithelial cells. We have studied the alpha-subunits of these heterodimeric pumps to identify the protein domains responsible for their polarized sorting. A chimeric alpha-subunit construct (N519H) was generated in which the first 519 amino acid residues correspond to the Na-K-ATPase sequence and the remaining 500 amino acids are derived from the H-K-ATPase sequence. In stably transfected LLC-PK1 cell lines, we found that the N519H chimera is restricted to the basolateral surface under steady-state conditions, suggesting that residues within the NH2-terminal 519 amino acids of the Na-K-ATPase alpha-subunit contain a basolateral sorting signal. H-K-ATPase beta-subunit expressed alone in LLC-PK1 cells accumulates at the apical surface. When coexpressed with N519H, the H-K-ATPase beta-subunit assembles with this chimera and accompanies it to the basolateral surface. Thus the NH2-terminal basolateral signal in the Na-K-ATPase alpha-subunit masks or is dominant over any apical sorting information present in the beta-polypeptide. In gastric parietal cells, the H-K-ATPase beta-subunit targets the H-K-ATPase to an intracellular vesicular compartment which fuses with the plasma membrane in response to secretagogue stimulation. To test whether the chimera-H-K-ATPase beta-subunit complex is directed to a similar compartment in LLC-PK1 cells, we treated transfected cells with drugs that raise intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Elevation of cytosolic cAMP increased the surface expression of both the N519H chimera and the H-K-ATPase beta-subunit. This increase in surface expression, however, appears to be the result of transcriptional upregulation and not recruitment of chimera to the surface from a cAMP-inducible compartment.},

This paper suggests a possible explanation: even in the presence of food markets, Third World farmers' food security is best assured by food self-sufficiency. A model of crop portfolio choice under multivariate risk is used to show that reasonable assumptions regarding risk and preferences reproduce the observed pattern. Simulations further indicate that food market integration reduces the need for food self-sufficiency.

abstract = {We examine the economic and environmental impact that the installation of 3 GW of marine energy capacity would have on Scotland. This is not a forecast, but a projection of the likely effects of meeting the Scottish Government's targets for renewable energy through the development of a marine energy sector. Energy, with a particular focus on renewables, is seen by the Scottish Government as a "key sector", with high growth potential and the capacity to boost productivity (Scottish Government, 2007a. The Government Economic Strategy. The Scottish Government, Edinburgh). The key nature of this sector has been identified through targets being set for renewable energy to achieve environmental and economic benefits. Using a regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Scotland we show that the development of a marine energy sector can have substantial and beneficial impacts on GDP, employment and the environment over the lifetime of the devices, given the encouragement of strong indigenous inter-industry linkages. Furthermore, there are also substantial "legacy" effects that persist well beyond the design life of the devices.},

abstract = {This chapter on urbanization and growth focuses on modeling and empirical evidence that pertain to a number of inter-related questions. Why do cities form in an economy, with so much of economic activity in countries geographically concentrated in cities? Second, how do different types of cities interact with each other in terms of trade and migration? Given the answers to these questions the chapter turns to growth issues. How does a system of cities evolve under economic and population growth; and how does urban growth intersect with, or even define national economic growth? In growth theory, endogenous growth is based on knowledge spillovers and sharing, and evidence suggests that much of that interaction must occur at the level of individual cities. In the early stages of growth, economic development is characterized by urbanization - a spatial transformation of the economy, where the population moves through migration from an agricultural, rural based existence to one where production occurs in cities of endogenous numbers and size. How do we model that transformation process and what are the key aspects of the transformation? In any static, growth, or development-urbanization context, how do governance, institutions, and public policy affect city formation and sizes, which then in turn affect economic efficiency. Cities require enormous public infrastructure investments which affect urban quality of life, in particular health and safety and commuting and congestion costs. Institutions governing land markets, property rights, local government autonomy, and local financing affect the city formation process and city sizes. And national government policies concerning trade, labor policies and national investment in communications and transport infrastructure affect the shape of the urban system. A final set of questions has to do with where cities locate. What is the effect of history, of climate and of natural resource locations, including rivers and natural harbors, on the location of current urban agglomerations?},

abstract = {This paper considers choice between individual projects and shows that when the choice set includes arbitrary distributions, then any assumed relationship between expected utility theory and general moment preferences for individual decision makers is theoretically unsound. In particular, a risk averse investor with any common utility function may, when choosing between two positive return opportunities, prefer the project simultaneously having a lower mean, higher variance, and lower positive skewness. Moreover, the decision maker can prefer opportunities with higher variance even when the opportunities are continuous, unimodal, and arbitrarily visually and statistically close to the normal distribution in shape. Our conclusions hold for any decision maker with a utility function whose derivatives alternate in sign being strictly positive or negative (i.e., we exclude the uninteresting cases of quadratic and cubic utilities). The method of analysis is based upon the theory of Tchebychev systems of functions which deals with the expected value of [utility] functions of stochastic variables with known moments. Although we focus on the first three moments, the results, as presented here, apply to all higher moments as well. It is also shown that there can be extremely large deviations between the certainty equivalents of distributions having the same moments, so this result is also pertinent to practical decision analysts as well. The paper demonstrates that the properties of utility functions have implications which are much more subtle than previously recognized for evaluating distributions in terms of their moments.},

The simulation experiments suggest that the impacts of trade liberalisation depend on wage-setting conditions in the urban region. With a fixed urban real wage, trade reform adversely affects overall economic growth mainly because of large contractions in the urban region. If urban nominal wage is flexible, both rural and urban regions experience expansion in GDP. An important policy implication of this analysis is that the success of trade liberalisation critically depends on the extent to which product and labour market reforms are synchronised. On the other hand, simultaneous implementations of nominal devaluation and reductions in external trade tariffs would not enhance structural transformation of the economy. However, this policy conflict does not necessarily arise if the introduction and implementation of different policy instruments of trade reforms are appropriately sequenced.},

abstract = {On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Innovation System research, this paper presents an extensive literature review on this large field of innovation research. Building on an analytical basis of the commonalities “system” and “innovation”, the authors analyze the four main Innovation System approaches: National Innovation Systems (NIS), Regional Innovation Systems (RIS), Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis is structured systematically along ten comprehensive criteria. Starting with the founder(s) of each theory and the research program within each Innovation System approach was developed (1), the basic thoughts of each Innovation System approach are explained (2). For five case studies most cited (3), spatial boundaries are examined (4) and units of analyses are derived (5). By comparing the underlying theoretical concept and empirical results, the authors show patterns in the evolution of Innovation System research overall. By studying the basic components (6) and a functional analysis (7), each Innovation System approach is broken down into structural pieces and functional processes. If available, the authors present one or several taxonomies (8) for each Innovation System approach and summarize similar approaches (9), in order to classify and integrate the approaches into the ongoing innovation research. The identification of further research (10) shows which steps will need to be taken in the next years in order to evolve Innovation System research further and deeper. After the conclusion, the extensive table of comparison is presented which can serve as a guideline for academics and practitioners from basic and applied science, industry or policy that need to understand which Innovation System approach may be best for their specific analytical purposes.},

abstract = {The USAGE model for the United States is used to quantify economic costs due to stock mispricing, made operational by shocking Tobin's q. The simulations quantify a potentially large impact even in the most favorable environment, where export demand holds up, and, the dollar is pro-cyclical. A two-year investment boom in two sectors increases consumption by a Net Present Value (NPV) amount of nearly one per cent, due to a positive investment externality onto the US terms of trade. If the investment is wasted, however, the consumption loss is nearly one-half of a per cent. A 5 year [`]capital strike' across the whole economy subsequent to the boom-mimicking financial distress from a burst bubble-shaves around 10 per cent off consumption. Given these significant costs associated with "boom" and "bust" equity markets, we consider some, policy options that might result in greater stability in these markets.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effect that international migration and remittances have on agricultural outcomes at the household level in El Salvador. Panel data are used to examine land use allocations, agricultural asset accumulation, and agricultural input use and returns. Findings suggest that migration and remittances cause a household to reallocate land away from commercial cash crops toward the production of subsistence food crops. There is weak evidence that migration and remittances contribute positively to agricultural asset accumulation in the form of land and livestock holdings. Further, results suggest that migration and remittance do not affect agricultural input use and may decrease the returns to land and labour on farm, as migrant households farm their land less intensively than non-migrant households.},

@article{Levitt2009c,
abstract = {This study presents an overview of modern field experiments and their usage in economics. Our discussion focuses on three distinct periods of field experimentation that have influenced the economics literature. The first might well be thought of as the dawn of “field” experimentation: the work of Neyman and Fisher, who laid the experimental foundation in the 1920s and 1930s by conceptualizing randomization as an instrument to achieve identification via experimentation with agricultural plots. The second, the large-scale social experiments conducted by government agencies in the mid-twentieth century, moved the exploration from plots of land to groups of individuals. More recently, the nature and range of field experiments has expanded, with a diverse set of controlled experiments being completed outside of the typical laboratory environment. With this growth, the number and types of questions that can be explored using field experiments has grown tremendously. After discussing these three distinct phases, we speculate on the future of field experimental methods, a future that we envision including a strong collaborative effort with outside parties, most importantly private entities.},

To shed light on this question, we randomized access to noninterest-bearing bank accounts among two types of self-employed individuals in rural Kenya: market vendors (who are mostly women) and men working as bicycle taxi drivers. Despite large withdrawal fees, a substantial share of market women used the accounts, were able to save more, and increased their productive investment and private expenditures. We see no impact for bicycle-taxi drivers. These results imply significant barriers to savings and investment for market women in our study context. (JEL D14, G21, J16, J23, O12, O14, O16)},

Using the margins of the 2011 Australian floods (Brisbane) as a natural experimental setting, we find that homeowners who were victims of the floods and face large losses in property values are 50{\%} more likely to opt for a risky gamble – a scratch card giving a small chance of a large gain ({\$}500,000) – than for a sure amount of comparable value ({\$}10). This finding is consistent with prospect theory predictions of the adoption of a risk-seeking attitude after a loss.},

The paper finds that households respond to crop losses primarily by intensifying fishing effort, not by relying on gathering of nontimber forest products, hunting, or asset liquidation. This ex post labor adjustment helps to smooth total income against small crop losses but less well against large crop losses. Both relatively nonpoor households with better fishing capital and poor young households with a physical labor advantage employ this natural insurance in rivers.},

Drawing upon 12 months of primary field research conducted in 2001-02, it shows how design faults, administrative mismanagement, and local power relations excluded very poor and lower caste people from participating in the program. The main problem areas were ineffective village assemblies (Gram Sabhas), the engagement of "contractors," the selection of beneficiaries by contractors, inappropriate wage setting, payments in cash instead of grain, the use of labor-displacing machinery, and disregard of the labor: material ratio in works executed.

The results indicated that consumers' perceived body-related self-discrepancy from online models had a direct relationship with body dissatisfaction. Consumers with higher enduring apparel involvement tended to feel a higher degree of body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was positively related to five concerns with fit and size of garment dimensions. Enduring apparel involvement was negatively related to concerns with overall appearance and concerns with imagining fit/size in online shopping. Finally, two of the concerns with fit and size of garment dimensions (concerns with overall appearance and concerns with imagining fit/size in online shopping) were negatively related to purchase intentions.},

The paper focuses on the impacts of three main components of Turkey's possible EU membership: (i) the free movement of labor between the EU and Turkey, (ii) the free movement of capital, and (iii) the burden-sharing of Turkey in terms of the EU's environmental objectives in the horizon of 2020, that is, the reduction of carbon emissions. Among these, a particular focus is placed on the influence of the CO2 emission reduction targets in both regions and their consequences on the carbon price in 2020. We estimate the resource allocation effects of EU climate change policies on both regions by taking into account the likely labor movement from Turkey to the EU and capital movement in the reverse direction. The results show that different emission targets for the two regions bring about a change in comparative advantages and thus a change in interregional competitiveness.},

abstract = {New technologies for innovative interactive experience represent a powerful medium to deliver cultural heritage content to a wider range of users. Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

@article{Muth2001b,
abstract = {Background Stem cells, having the property of self renewal, offer the promise of lifelong repair of damaged tissue. However, somatic tissue-committed primary stem cells are rare and difficult to expand in vitro. Genetically modified stem-like cells with the ability to expand conditionally provide a valuable tool with which to study stem cell biology, especially the cellular events of proliferation and differentiation. In addition, stem cells may be appropriate candidates for therapeutic applications. Methods Double transgenic mice possesing SV40 T antigen (Tag) under the control of the reverse tetracycline-transactivator (rtTA) were used to establish cell lines. One brain cell line was partially characterized by DNA sequencing, morphology, antigen expression using flow cytometry confocal microscopy,, and electrophysiology using the patch clamp technique. Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining; cell viability and H-3-thymidine incorporation assays. The ability of this cell line to differentiate was assessed by confocal microscopy following co-culture with stem cells secreting cytokines. Results We report here the establishment and partial characterization of a cell line derived from the brain tissue of rtTA-SV40 Tag transgenic mice. Analysis of the morphology and antigen markers has shown that this cell line mimics some aspects of primary glial precursors. The results of electrophysiology are consistent with this and suggest that the cell line is derived from O2A glial precursor cells. Cell cycle progression of this cell line is doxycycline-dependent. In the absence of doxycycline, cells become apoptotic. Differentiation into mature type 2 astrocytes and (precursor) oligodendrocytes can be induced upon withdrawal of doxycycline and addition of epithelial stem cells secreting cytokine, such as hIL3 (human Interleukine 3) or hIL6 to the culture. In contrast, co-culturing with hCNTF (human Ciliary NeuroTrophic Factor)-secreting epithelial stem cells did not induce them to mature into progeny cell types. Conclusion The differentiation of this O2A glial precursor line does not occur automatically in culture. Additional external help is required from the cell-based delivery of appropriate transgenic cytokines. Withdrawal of doxycycline from the culture medium removes the proliferation signals and induces a fatal outcome. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This study examines the adoption of (1) . P. vannamei and (2) adoption of formulated shrimp feeds, both technologies critical to increasing productivity of shrimp farming in Indonesia. The primary objective was to identify if land-poor or capital-poor farm households were excluded in adopting . P. vannamei and/or the adoption of feed. The study used primary data we collected in Indonesia to estimate adoption equations. We found: (1) There is no evidence for farm-scale barriers in the adoption of . P. vannamei. (2) The lack of productive assets (pumps for example) is a significant constraint to adoption of . P. vannamei and shrimp feed. This may constitute a "low-productivity trap" in aquaculture - with the asset-poor relegated to producing the unproductive . P. monodon without external inputs. (3) In the adoption of feed, there is a strong threshold effect at half of a hectare. Micro-farms are a unique subset of the farming population that are oftentimes the most productive in farming a local species, like . P. monodon, but are constrained in fully-intensive adoption of novel production systems. There are two implications for policy. First, policies that encourage the development of hatcheries and feed mills in small farmer areas will promote productivity and modernization of small shrimp farming. The second is that constraints to capital assets like pumps limit small farmer adoption of new technologies. Promotion of financial markets that help small farmers to invest in these productive assets will open doors to technological change in small farming areas. Statement of relevance: This study focuses on adoption of a shrimp species new to small farmers in Indonesia, as well as adoption of feed. Contrary to conventional wisdom we found that small farmers adopted both, without land constraints affecting diffusion, but productive capital constraints hold back small farmers from adoption.},

We find that China's household saving rate has been high and rising and that the main determinants of variations over time and over space therein are the lagged saving rate, the income growth rate, (in many cases) the real interest rate, and (in some cases) the inflation rate. However, we find that the variables relating to the age structure of the population have the expected impact on the household saving rate in only one of the four samples. These results provide mixed support for the life cycle hypothesis as well as the permanent income hypothesis, are consistent with the existence of inertia or persistence, and imply that China's household saving rate will remain high for some time to come.},

The paper also explores repercussions on the efficiency and output of the social maintenance or "subsistence" sector due to the loss of female laborpower to the male-controlled export sector. Finally, the impact of an International Monetary Fund mandated currency devaluation on an economy of this type is considered as well.},

abstract = {M achines are increasingly doing " intelligent " things: Facebook recognizes faces in photos, Siri understands voices, and Google translates websites. The fundamental insight behind these breakthroughs is as much statis-tical as computational. Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the pres-ence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: Are these algorithms merely applying standard techniques to novel and large datasets? If there are fundamentally new empirical tools, how do they fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? 1 We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Central to our understanding is that machine learning 1 In this journal, Varian (2014) provides an excellent introduction to many of the more novel tools and " tricks " from machine learning, such as decision trees or cross-validation. Einav and Levin (2014) describe big data and economics more broadly. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hanson (2014) present an econometrically thorough introduction on how LASSO (and close cousins) can be used for inference in high-dimensional data. Athey (2015) provides a brief overview of how machine learning relates to causal inference.},

This article draws on evidence from time-budget surveys--three from the United States (1965, 1975, and 1985) and three from the United Kingdom (1961, 1974, and 1984)--to investigate the evolution of housework time for men and women over the last three decades. Clearly much other than housework has changed over this period. More women have paid jobs, more men are unemployed, and families have gotten smaller on average. Even having controlled for such sociodemographic changes, we conclude that in the two countries, women in the 1980s do substantially less housework than those in equivalent circumstances in the 1960s, and that men do a little more than they did (although still much less than women). These changes correspond closely to developments in four other countries (Canada, Holland, Denmark, and Norway) for which historical time-budget evidence is available.},

We find an inverted-U-shaped relationship between household endowments and the likelihood of migration. Over time, the poor are more likely to migrate. Using household panel data and taking prior village migration networks as an instrument, we find that having a migrant increases a household's income per capita by 8.5 to 13.1 percent, but that the overall impact on poverty is modest because most poor people do not migrate. Migrants remit a large share of their income and the amount of these remittances is responsive somewhat to the needs of other family members. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (4) (2005) 688–709.},

abstract = {Investments in agricultural water management should complement or strengthen the livelihood and coping systems of the rural poor, and should thus be instrumental for breaking the poverty trap in Ethiopia. Underdeveloped water resources constrain progress towards poverty reduction. We examine linkages and complementarities between agricultural water, education, markets and rural poverty through an empirical study using household level data from selected villages in southern Ethiopia. We show that investments in irrigation can contribute to poverty reduction, but the poverty reducing impacts of irrigation water are greater when human capital and rural markets are well developed. The size of landholding, access to irrigation water, on-farm land and water conservation practices, literacy of the household head, and years of education of adults are all significant determinants of household welfare, and thus potential pathways for reducing poverty. Expansion of cultivated land, particularly irrigated land, universal literacy, and an extra school year for adults all reduce poverty, but reductions in poverty are greater when irrigation is combined with universal literacy. These findings call for simultaneous investments in agricultural water, education, markets and related policy support measures for reducing poverty in smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia.},

The conceptual and empirical evidence suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating smallholder organization, at reducing the costs of intermarket commerce, and, perhaps especially, at improving poorer households' access to improved technologies and productive assets are central to stimulating smallholder market participation and escape from semi-subsistence poverty traps. Macroeconomic and trade policy tools appear less useful in inducing market participation by poor smallholders in the region.},

abstract = {Unlike what is commonly believed, the last two decades have not witnessed the twilight of industrial policy. Instead, incentives and subsidies have been refocused on exports and direct foreign investment, in the belief that these activities are the source of significant positive spillovers. The challenge in most developing countries is not to rediscover industrial policy, but to redeploy it in a more effective manner. This paper lays out an institutional framework for accomplishing this objective. A central argument is that the task of industrial policy is as much about eliciting information from the private sector on significant externalities and their remedies as it is about implementing appropriate policies. The right model for industrial policy is not that of an autonomous government applying Pigovian taxes or subsidies, but of strategic collaboration between the private sector and the government with the aim of uncovering where the most significant obstacles to restructuring lie and what type of interventions are most likely to remove them.},

There is a growing body of empirical literature on this topic and many studies provide mixed results. In this study, Sri Lanka is used as a detailed case study and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is used as an analytical framework to examine the trade-poverty nexus. The results suggest that, liberalisation of the manufacturing industries is more pro-poor than that of the agricultural industries. Overall, this study suggests that trade reforms may widen the income gap between the rich and the poor creating uneven gains across different household groups in Sri Lanka. While short-term complementary policies are needed to compensate vulnerable income groups, long-term policies are needed to make gains from trade liberalisation more inclusive and equitable to maintain economic and political stability in Sri Lanka.},

abstract = {In this paper, we simulate the labor market effects of net immigration and emigration during the 1990's in all OECD countries. To accomplish this, we are the first to employ a comprehensive database of migrant stocks, grouped by education level and country of origin/destination, for the years 1990 and 2000. Due to the much higher international mobility of college graduates, relative to all other individuals, we find that net migration flows are college-intensive, relative to the population of non-migrants. Using the consensus aggregate model of labor demand and supply we simulate the long-run employment and wage effects of immigration and emigration. We use a range of parameter values spanning most of the estimates in the literature. In all cases we find that immigration had a positive effect on the wage of less educated natives. It also increased or left the average native wages unchanged and had a positive or no effect on native employment. To the contrary, emigration had a negative effect on the wage of less educated native workers and it contributed to increase within country inequality in all OECD countries. These results still hold true when we correct for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, for the skill-downgrading of immigrants, when we focus on immigration from non-OECD countries, and when we consider preliminary measures of more recent immigration flows for the period 2000-2007.},

We provide additional evidence on the possible effect of such programs by describing the results of a randomized field experiment whose main purpose was to increase the use of contraceptive methods in rural areas of Ethiopia. In the experiment, administrative areas were randomly allocated to one of three intervention groups or to a fourth control group. In the first intervention group, both credit and family planning services were provided and the credit officers also provided information on family planning. Only credit or family planning services, but not both, were provided in the other two intervention groups, while areas in the control group received neither type of service. Using pre- and post-intervention surveys, we find that neither type of program, combined or in isolation, led to an increase in contraceptive use that is significantly greater than that observed in the control group. We conjecture that the lack of impact has much to do with the mismatch between women's preferred contraceptive method (injectibles) and the contraceptives provided by community-based agents (pills and condoms).},

While 84{\%} of farmers are expected to gain from the technology, only 7{\%} adopt in networks. Conversely, 40{\%} of farmers adopt when demand is revealed in door-to-door sales. Using variation across the sample in estimated gains in revenue, I show that 63{\%} of the gains from door-to-door sales are lost with decentralized trade through networks. Frictions preventing interactions between farmers from diﬀerent social groups oﬀer an explanation for the results. Sub-caste and surname association with suppliers are strong predictors of adoption in networks, but have no eﬀect in door-to-door sales.},

abstract = {In India, despite improvements in access to health care, inequalities are related to socioeconomic status, geography, and gender, and are compounded by high out-of-pocket expenditures, with more than three-quarters of the increasing financial burden of health care being met by households. Health-care expenditures exacerbate poverty, with about 39 million additional people falling into poverty every year as a result of such expenditures. We identify key challenges for the achievement of equity in service provision, and equity in financing and financial risk protection in India. These challenges include an imbalance in resource allocation, inadequate physical access to high-quality health services and human resources for health, high out-of-pocket health expenditures, inflation in health spending, and behavioural factors that affect the demand for appropriate health care. Use of equity metrics in monitoring, assessment, and strategic planning; investment in development of a rigorous knowledge base of health-systems research; development of a refined equity-focused process of deliberative decision making in health reform; and redefinition of the specific responsibilities and accountabilities of key actors are needed to try to achieve equity in health care in India. The implementation of these principles with strengthened public health and primary-care services will help to ensure a more equitable health care for India's population.},

abstract = {Despite numerous studies on labor supply, the size of elasticities is rarely comparable across countries. In this paper, we suggest the first large-scale international comparison of elasticities, while netting out possible differences due to methods, data selection and the period of investigation. We rely on comparable data for 17 European countries and the US, a common empirical approach and a complete simulation of tax-benefit policies affecting household budgets. We find that wage-elasticities are small and vary less across countries than previously thought, e.g., between .2 and .6 for married women. Results are robust to several modeling assumptions. We show that differences in tax-benefit systems or demographic compositions explain little of the cross-country variation, leaving room for other interpretations, notably in terms of heterogeneous work preferences. We derive important implications for research on optimal taxation.},

The interview method is subject to interviewer bias and its results were totally inconsistent with the experimental measures of risk aversion. Experimental measures indicate that, at high payoff levels, virtually all individuals are moderately risk-averse with little variation according to personal characteristics. Wealth tends to reduce risk aversion slightly, but its effect is not statistically significant.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to provide a systematic analysis of some aspects of structural change in an open economy. In particular, we are concerned with an increasingly common phenomenon in both developed and developing countries, sometimes referred to as the 'Dutch disease': the coexistence within the traded goods sector of progressing and declining, or booming and lagging, sub-sectors. In many cases - minerals in Australia, natural gas in the Netherlands, or oil in the United Kingdom, Norway and some members of OPEC -the booming sector is of an extractive kind, and it is the traditional manufacturing sector which is placed under pressure. Hence a major aim of the paper is to explore the nature of the resulting pressures towards 'de-industrialisation'. However, our analysis is equally applicable to cases where the booming sector is not extractive (such as the displacement of older industry by technologically more advanced activities in Ireland, Japan or Switzerland). This is so because we are primarily concerned with the medium-run effects of asymmetric growth on resource allocation and income distribution, rather than with the longer-run issue of optimal depletion rates which has been the focus of recent work on the economics of exhaustible resources. (See Dasgupta and Heal, 1978.) Moreover, in order to highlight the structural aspects of a boom we ignore monetary considerations and focus on its implications for real rather than nominal variables. We are thus able to draw on and extend the standard tools of international trade theory in order to throw light on the specific problem of a sectoral boom.},

We argue that migration is a cumulative process with varying health effects at different stages of its progression, and test several related hypotheses. Findings suggest higher rates of infant mortality in communities experiencing intense U.S. migration. However, two factors diminish the disruptive effects of migration: migradollars, or migrant remittances to villages, and the institutionalization of migration over time. Mortality risks are low when remittances are high and decrease as migration becomes increasingly salient to livelihoods of communities. Together, the findings indicate eventual benefits to all infants, irrespective of household migration experience, as a result of the development of social and economic processes related to U.S. migration.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes and extends previous research that has shown evidence of a “curse of natural resources” – countries with great natural resource wealth tend nevertheless to grow more slowly than resource-poor countries. This result is not easily explained by other variables, or by alternative ways to measure resource abundance. This paper shows that there is little direct evidence that omitted geographical or climate variables explain the curse, or that there is a bias resulting from some other unobserved growth deterrent. Resource-abundant countries tended to be high-price economies and, perhaps as a consequence, these countries tended to miss-out on export-led growth.},

Globalization can not only cause many hardships for the rural poor, but it can also open up some opportunities which some countries can utilize and others do not, largely depending on their domestic political and economic institutions, and the net outcome is often quite complex and almost always context dependent, belying the glib pronouncements for or against globalization made in the opposing camps.},

abstract = {The Living Standards Measurement Study—Integrated Surveys on Agriculture project collects agricultural and livelihood data in seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. To maintain representativeness as much as possible overmultiple rounds of data collection, a subsample of households is selected to have members that have left the household tracked and interviewed in their new location with their new household members. Since the subsampling occurs at the level of the household but tracking occurs at the level of the individual, a number of issues arise with the correct calculation for the subsampling and attrition corrections. This article is based on the panel weight calculations for the initial rounds of the Integrated Surveys on Agriculture surveys in Uganda and Tanzania, and describes themethodology used for calculating the weight components related to subsampling, tracking, and attrition, as well as the criteria used for trimming and post-stratification. It also addresses complications resulting from members previously classified as having attrited from the sample returning in later rounds.},

abstract = {With increasing urbanization, the demands for high quality agricultural products induced changes in local cropping patterns. Although grain production still occupied a large portion in sown and planted areas, the share of sown areas declined from 67{\%} to 44{\%} for total grain crops, and 54{\%} to 35{\%} for rice between 1989 and 2002 in Fujian province. The change in crop spectrum and land use by urbanization has resulted in two extreme trends in topsoil — nutrient depletion in grain-dominated regions and nutrient overload in city suburbs. The positive correlation between nitrogen balance and local urban population in some years showed that urbanization affected nutrient balance in topsoil. The rapid changes in land use and crop spectrum caused by urbanization therefore created a challenge to the traditional soil nutrient management derived mainly from paddy fields and an urgent need for new management schemes in the province. The study provides valuable insights into nutrient management and soil sustainability in the context of rapid urbanization and population growth in Fujian.},

abstract = {This article assesses the efficacy of the strategy of immigration control implemented by the US government since 1993 in reducing illegal entry attempts, and documents some of the unintended consequences of this strategy, especially a sharp increase in mortality among unauthorized migrants along certain segments of the Mexico-US border. The available data suggest that the current strategy of border enforcement has resulted in rechanneling flows of unauthorized migrants to more hazardous areas, raising fees charged by people-smugglers, and discouraging unauthorized migrants already in the US from returning to their places of origin. However, there is no evidence that the strategy is deterring or preventing significant numbers of new illegal entries, particularly given the absence of a serious effort to curtail employment of unauthorized migrants through worksite enforcement. An expanded temporary worker program, selective legalization of unauthorized Mexican workers residing in the United States, and other proposals under consideration by the US and Mexican governments are unlikely to reduce migrant deaths resulting from the current strategy of border enforcement.},

The effect on choices varies by religion. For example, priming causes Protestants to increase contributions to public goods, whereas Catholics decrease contributions to public goods, expect others to contribute less to public goods, and become less risk averse. A simple model implies that priming effects reveal the sign of the marginal impact of religious norms on steady-state preferences. We find no evidence of religious priming effects on disutility of work effort, discount rates, or dictator game generosity.},

This restriction of the neoclassical model of family behavior is tested for the determination of husband and wife labor supply and fertility based on the 1981 Socioeconomic Survey of Thailand. The neoclassical restriction is rejected for female labor supply and fertility. Another unexplored limitation of family demand studies, due to the sample self selection of intact marriages, is empirically treated through alternative estimation strategies. In this case, a more sharply focused theory of marital behavior is needed to identify family demand models.},

Many studies have evaluated the growth impacts of the tourism sector but few have analyzed the impact of tourism on the economy and poverty at the subnational level in developing countries. As a country marked by a “dual economy,” Panama shares with other Latin American countries a fast growing, modern urban sector side by side with impoverished rural and peri-urban populations.

This paper presents the results of a top-down assessment of the impact of tourism spending on growth and poverty at the regional (province) level in Panama using a Social Accounting Matrix model. As revealed by this study, the tourism sector has large multiplier effects on the Panamanian economy and has the potential for significant benefits to the poor. But tourism's poverty benefits are neither automatic nor ubiquitous. They depend on where and how supply chains are structured and on the way tourists spend their money.},

abstract = {This chapter traces the evolution of the agricultural economics literature on agrifood output markets over the past 50 years, emphasizing research approaches and policy issues. The analysis of agrifood systems encompasses the demand and supply side of output markets. The analysis in this chapter is set within the conceptual framework of how the agrifood economy develops during the agricultural and structural transformation. The related paths of development of policy and policy issues, and research themes and methods, are analyzed in parallel. The chapter examines the shift from broad and atomistic "commodity" markets to differentiated and more concentrated "product" markets over the half century. Spurred by massive retail sector foreign direct investment (FDI) to which was added competitive investments from domestic capital, a profound retail transformation has occurred in the past decade - the "supermarket revolution". This revolution has been the leading edge of globalization of domestic agrifood systems, not, as the literature currently emphasizes, opening to international trade. The chapter ends with a focus on the challenge for researchers in the next several decades, especially the need for new research methodologies that are suitable for understanding the role and influence of a small number of large-scale, multi-national firms, and for analyzing the impacts of the consolidation of the downstream segments of the agrifood system - the food industry - on upstream segments of the domestic agrifood systems, on rural development, and on trade.},

We find that aid's distributional impact is equality enhancing, extremely small in terms of changes in inequality measures, but of some importance for the lowest decile of the distribution. We also find that some of this impact is counteracted by lost potential income in the lower deciles from merchandise trade barriers imposed by high-income countries.},

These changes, which encompass price control policies, exchange rate policies, commercial, tax, and financial reforms as well as privatization, have affected practically every aspect of the Salvadoran economy. In this paper, we concentrate on analyzing three structural adjustment areas in the country: trade liberalization, exchange rate policy and public finances. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated with 1990 data is used. There is a brief description of relevant aspects of structural adjustment reforms in El Salvador with special attention to the trade liberalization process. The structure of the CGE used is outlined together with the nature of the data. The last part of the paper presents the results of our simulations and draws some conclusions.},

abstract = {Farmers in high-income countries invest in the political process to gain access to foreign workers, with potentially far-reaching social welfare ramifications both at home and abroad. This review examines the unique features of the farm labor market that result in an intimate relationship between some types of agricultural production and migration policy. A theoretical model and Monte Carlo simulations are used to illustrate the farm labor problem. The agricultural labor history of the United States and comparisons of experiences across countries reveal a diversity of policies to secure workers for farms through immigration. There are reasons, however, to question the sustainability of a labor-intensive agricultural system's dependence upon low-cost imported labor.},

abstract = {Population aging has spurred developed countries around the world to reform their PAYG pension systems. In particular, delaying legal retirement ages and reducing the generosity of pension benefits have been widely implemented changes. This paper assesses the potential success of these policies in the case of the Spanish economy, and compares them with the results obtained by the (rather modest) reforms already implemented in 1997 and 2001. This evaluation is accomplished in a heterogeneous-agent dynamic general equilibrium model where individuals can adjust their retirement ages in response to changes to the pension rules. We check the ability of the model to reproduce the basic stylized facts of retirement behavior (particularly the pattern of early retirement induced by minimum pensions). The model is then used to explore the impact of pension reforms. We find that already implemented changes actually increase the implicit liabilities of the system. In contrast, delaying the legal retirement age and extending the averaging period in the pension formula to cover most of the individual's life-cycle can reduce the implicit liabilities substantially. These findings reveal the failure of the Spanish political system to distribute the costs of population aging more evenly across the generations.},

abstract = {This paper aims to examine the dynamics of land transactions, machine investments, and the demand for machine services using farm panel data from China. Recently, China's agriculture has experienced a large expansion of machine rentals and machine services provided by specialized agents, which has contributed to mechanization of agricultural production. On the other hand, the empirical results show that an increase in non-agricultural wage rates leads to expansion of self-cultivated land size. A rise in the proportion of non-agricultural income or the migration rate also increases the size of self-cultivated land. Interestingly, however, relatively educated farm households decrease the size of self-cultivated land, which suggests that relatively less educated farmers tend to specialize in farming. The demand for machine services has also increased if agricultural wage and migration rate increased over time, especially among relatively large farms. The results on crop income also support complementarities between rented-in land and machine services (demanded), which implies that scale economies are arising in Chinese agriculture with mechanization and active land rental markets.},

However, even the smallest incentive doubled that share. Using the randomly assigned incentives and distance from results centers as instruments for the knowledge of HIV status, sexually active HIV-positive individuals who learned their results are three times more likely to purchase condoms two months later than sexually active HIV-positive individuals who did not learn their results; however, HIV-positive individuals who learned their results purchase only two additional condoms than those who did not. There is no significant effect of learning HIV-negative status on the purchase of condoms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: On January 12, 2010, a powerful 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Republic of Haiti and destroyed Port-au-Prince, the capital and others cities across the country. While some studies have examined the long-term traumatic effects of the seismic event on children and adolescents victims, so far no study has examined the consequences on adults generally. As such, this study aims to investigate the traumatic consequences of the earthquake among adults related to degree of exposure, peritraumatic distress, depressive symptoms and sociodemographic factors two and a half years after. In addition, predictive factors of PTSD and depressive symptoms were also identified.

METHODS: From June to July 2012, a total of 1355 adults (660 women) was assessed by means the traumatic exposure questionnaire, the Life Events Checklist subscale, the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), in addition to social demographic characteristics.

RESULTS: The prevalence rates of PTSD and depressive symptoms were 36.75{\%} (498 cases) and 25.98{\%} (352 cases) respectively. The risk factors for PTSD and depressive symptoms were young and old age, female gender, unemployed status and low level of education. The bests predictives variables were peritraumatic distress for PTSD ($\beta$=.57, p{\textless}.0001) and for depressive symptoms ($\beta$=.21, p{\textless}.0001). The commorbidity between PTSD and depression was 13.36{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS: This study found that psychological symptoms are frequent event 30 months after the earthquake. The different mental health care providers, the public health ministry, NGOs working on the ground in Haiti should design programmes in order to aid the psychological wellbeing of the population focussing on youth, older and retired adults, females, people with low levels of education and those who do not work.},

abstract = {A farmer-managed, agroenvironmental transformation has occurred over the past three decades in the West African Sahel, enabling both land rehabilitation and agricultural intensification to support a dense and growing population. This paper traces the technical and institutional innovations, their impacts, and lessons learned from two successful examples. The first is the story of the improvement and replication of indigenous soil and water conservation practices across the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. Rehabilitation of at least 200,000 hectares of degraded land enabled farmers to grow cereals on land that had been barren and intensify production through developing agroforestry systems. Additionally, rehabilitation appears to have recharged local wells. The second example is a farmer-managed process of natural regeneration, using improved, local agroforestry practices over an estimated 5 million hectares in southern Niger. This large-scale effort reduced wind erosion and increased the production and marketing of crops, fodder, firewood, fruit, and other products. In both cases, income opportunities were created, reducing incentives for migration. Women benefited from the improved supply of water, fuelwood, and other tree products. Human, social, and political capital was strengthened in a process of farmer-driven change. Fluid coalitions of actors expanded the scale of the transformation. These stories have important lessons for those who seek to create effective agricultural development partnerships and meet the challenges of climate change and food security.},

abstract = {The microclimate of the greenhouse when considered as a relatively homogeneous entity is well understood, and there are models of crop growth, and environmental parameters that enable expert decision-support systems to be derived, and automatic environment controls affecting productivity to be designed. However, the microbial microclimate of pathogens in the boundary layer on the phylloplane is poorly understood, and disease escape measures are not yet incorporated into automatic environment control systems. Because biocontrol microorganisms necessarily inhabit the same ecological niche as microbial pathogens, describing environments on the phylloplane that encourage biological control without also enhancing pathogenesis presents very difficult engineering challenges. This review examines the dilemmas in designing environments that maximise productivity, encourage disease escape, and permit biological control.},

Three versions of the villagewide model are used to analyze the implications of rural market imperfections in shaping agricultural and trade policy impacts. Policy experiments reveal that maize-price liberalization under NAFTA will result in large changes in maize production but relatively small changes in household-farm incomes and migration. Increases in the productivity of family resources in household-farm production, unlike direct income payments currently being implemented in Mexico, can achieve both efficiency and income distribution gains while neutralizing the migration impact of maize price reforms.},

Several plausible and strong arguments apply - including the creation of jobs on the land, linkages from farming to the rest of the rural economy, and a decline in the real cost of food for the whole economy - but the degree of impact is in all cases qualified by particular circumstances. Hence, the article deploys a cross-country estimation of the links between agricultural yield per unit area and measures of poverty. This produces strong confirmation of the hypothesised linkages. It is unlikely that there are many other development interventions capable of reducing the numbers in poverty so effectively.},

@article{Cerna2013,
abstract = {Change is a major part of our lives, whether it is change in industries, technologies or various sectors such as transportation, education, health care or social policies. But we still know little about when and how change occurs. Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff, once said you never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Since 2008 policy-makers in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries have faced a serious economic crisis – but it remains to be seen whethe r this was an opportunity taken advantage of or missed completely. Do we need a major shock to the system to initiative change? Or can there be incremental change? The topic of policy change is a widely researched area in public policy and political scien ce. In fields such as education policy, however, there is often an untheoretical approach on ‘what works'. This paper seeks to fill this gap and provides a review of the main theoretical approaches to policy change. But policy change may not lead to desire d results if the process of implementation is omitted from consideration. Thus the main question is: how can we explain policy change and implementation? While there is a growing body of literature on policy change and implementation, this review can only engage with a few selected theories which were deemed the most applicable to education policy. The review proceeds in the following way: Section 2 presents a selection of the main theories and models of change, their strengths and weaknesses and their ap plicability to different policy areas. In particular, the following theories are discussed: path dependence, advocacy coalition framework, policy learning, policy diffusion, punctuated equilibrium, institutional change, multi-level governance, policy netwo rks, disruptive innovation as well as the politics of change and reform. Next, several key theories (such as top-down and bottom up approaches and rational choice including game theory) and lessons of policy implementation are presented in Section 3. Final ly, Section 4 finishes with some conclusions and ideas for further research and discussion. The review provides examples from country experiences to illustrate key points but it remains mostly theoretical and would benefit from additional empirical research.},

We find large differences in the extent and variety of non-farm production across municipalities and evidence of large entry and transportation costs.

abstract = {The Wenchuan County earthquake of 2008 was the most severe earthquake, as measured in sheer magnitude, in the history of the People's Republic of China. Killing almost 90,000 people and creating economic losses of 845 billion yuan (US{\$}132 billion), the earthquake also elicited a vigorous response from various government agencies, private businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The ways these actors' responses to the earthquake proved effective in distributing appropriate aid to those in need and the areas where the actors' earthquake response needs to be improved are discussed and analyzed in Earthquake Lessons from China: Coping and Rebuilding Strategies. The authors identify three earthquake responses that proved helpful to earthquake-affected communities: the use of a pair-wise aid policy, in which a donor province or city is assigned to give aid to a particular earthquake-affected area; expanded NGO and volunteer involvement; and various kinds of public financial aid to earthquake-affected households. They also pinpoint areas that need further work: public aid specifically for home reconstruction, which has been inadequate, and the capacity of local communities to manage their own disaster responses, which is too low. Perhaps most important, the authors found that the high levels of NGO and volunteer involvement in disaster response should be expanded and sustained beyond what they were in the aftermath of the 2008 earthquake. The authors believe that increased nonpublic sector involvement can not only improve the level of response to natural disasters but also foster a robust civil society and grassroots democracy in China. These and other findings that are discussed in Earthquake Lessons from China can assist the continued development of China's disaster management capacity—and also be useful to other countries facing similar disasters.},

@unpublished{Haddad1996,
abstract = {The success of development policy depends on the ability to successfully anticipate the response of individuals to changing incentives. Often, however, actual responses differ from anticipated responses. One important reason for this divergence is a poor understanding of how rights, responsibilities, and resources are allocated within institutions such as the household. The insights derived from intrahousehold research between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s on the determinants of food and nutritional status served as an important catalyst for the general development of the intrahousehold approach to development policy analysis. Despite serving as a building block for the wider study of intrahousehold resource allocation, there has not been an in-depth review of sex and gender differences in the food consumption and nutrition literature in the past 10 years. This paper seeks to fill this gap. In addition, the paper undertakes a review of the gender and poverty literature, because economic access to food is so fundamental to food security and nutrition. Why is this an important gap to fill? First, the availability of a series of new food consumption and nutrition studies from the past 10 years affords us an opportunity to get a clearer picture of where intrahousehold and sex differences in food and nutrition occur. Second, the availability of a number of intrahousehold studies from outside the food and nutrition community may have some important lessons for food and nutrition programming. Finally, a number of important measurement issues have emerged in the past 10 years and their importance can be illustrated well in a review of studies such as this. These three considerations, then, form the basis for formulating the objectives of the paper. Specifically, the paper aims to (1) critically review the existing literature and studies on the distribution of food and other proximate factors within the household (with an emphasis on boy-girl differences), (2) critically review the existing literature and studies in the areas of poverty and gender, gender and income earning, drawing out implications for food and nutrition programs, and (3) highlight some important methodological concerns related to poverty, income, and food consumption measurement.},

@article{Huchzermeyer2001,
abstract = {Official discussion and negotiation on housing policy in South Africa was closed in 1994 with the launch of the new Housing White Paper. Contradictions in this policy between housing procedure and delivery target have limited its relevance to the poorest sector in society. The paper shows how these tensions between product and process are an outcome of negotiated policy-making, in which the attempt was to combine the dominant position of the private sector for the commodification of housing, with people-centred housing procedures advocated by the democratic movement. In the second term of ANC government, the housing ministry, aware of some of the limitations of its policy, stated its intention to review the housing policy. This has led to renewed discussion. The paper traces shifts and continuities in recent positions on housing in South Africa. It traces their emergence from within the democratic movement including labour and community or civic organisation, the more recent Homeless People's Federation/People's Dialogue alliance, and the private sector with its influential Urban Foundation and subsequent policy research institutes. The paper argues that shifts in housing finance have largely ignored the needs of the poorest sector in society. Further, the inadequately integrated location of subsidised development for the poorest remains unchallenged. The perception of local government merely as implementer in a centralised programme limits the ability to address local realities, also imposing bureaucratic constraints on community-based construction. In addition, an evasive discourse on squatting does not lend itself to the formulation of mechanism of intervention oriented around the needs of the poor. These limitations in addressing poverty through housing policy should inform future research on shelter in South Africa.},

This theoretical approach, widely known as "New Economic Geography" (NEG), emphasizes the interaction between transport costs and firm-level scale economies as a source of agglomeration. NEG focuses on forward and backward trade linkages as causes of observed spatial concentration of economic activity. We survey the existing literature, organizing the papers we discuss under the rubric of five interesting and testable hypotheses that emerge from NEG theory. We conclude the chapter with an overall assessment of the empirical support for NEG and suggest some directions for future research.},

Key distortions to the economy of Kyangwali Refugee Settlement in Uganda are noted and the findings are used to construct a generic model of a refugee camp economy. Camp economies are influenced by host country policies, such as restrictions on refugees' movement and work, as well as by the physical and economic isolation of the site. Moreover, market outcomes interact with the nature of humanitarian assistance and the special demographic composition of the refugees to determine the prices and quantities that characterize the market. An awareness of the dynamics of the refugee camp economy has important implications for practitioners and scholars alike. Keywords:},

abstract = {Are migration networks associated with lower capital costs, or the alleviation of capital constraints? We examine these questions with data measuring access to remittance flows among small-scale entrepreneurs in Mexico. Using a survey of more than 6000 self-employed workers and small firm owners located in 44 urban areas of Mexico, we estimate the impact of attachment to migration networks on the level of capital investment, the capital-output ratio, sales, and profits of microenterprises. The impact is identified from the geographic pattern of migration from Mexico driven by the completion of rail lines in the early 1900s. For the full sample of firms, we find that migration is associated with higher investment levels and higher profits, but not higher sales. The strongest effects on investment are in the categories of automobiles, tools and inventories. When the sample is limited to firms in high-capital sectors, investment, sales, and profits all increase with attachment to the migration networks, suggesting that attachment to the migration network alleviates capital constraints in those sectors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the stylized facts in developing countries is the wide variation in agricultural per-acre input and output levels across farm households. Here we focus on the variation in the level of chemical fertilizer applied, in particular to high-yielding wheat. The model used to explain the variation in fertilizer input across farms incorporates the process by which `zeros' are generated, in particular differentiating between households who do not apply because of `lack of access' and those who do not apply out of choice. We find that access is positively correlated with farm size but that, among users, per-acre fertilizer levels decrease with farm size. We interpret the latter by appealing to input choice under uncertainty. With this interpretation, our results suggest that, although larger farms have a higher level of non-stochastic wealth which, in the presence of decreasing absolute risk aversion, has the effect of increasing fertilizer intensity with farm size, the presence of increasing relative risk aversion means that the net relationship between farm size and fertilizer intensity is negative. This latter affect appears to dominate any tendancy for higher fertilizer intensity on larger farms arising from better knowledge or irrigation facilities.},

abstract = {We show that the credit crisis of OECD countries has a negative impact on the growth of the world economy according to an error-correction model including China and Australia. This causes negative growth effects in poor developing countries. The reduced growth has a direct or indirect impact on the convergence issue, aid, remittances, labour force growth, investment and savings, net foreign debt, migration, tax revenues, public expenditure on education and literacy. We estimate dynamic equations of all these variables using dynamic panel data methods for a panel of countries with per capita income below {\$}1200 (2000). The estimated equations are then integrated to a dynamic system of thirteen equations for thirteen variables that allows for highly non-linear baseline simulations for these open economies. Then we analyze the effects of transitional shocks as predicted by the international organizations for the OECD and world growth for 2008 and 2009. Whereas growth rates return to the baseline scenario until 2013 with overshooting for China and Australia, the level of the GDP per capita shows permanent effects, which are positive only for China. In the poor countries, investment, remittances, savings, tax revenues, public expenditure on education, all as a share of GDP as well as literacy and the GDP per capita, are reduced compared to the baseline until 2087 where our analysis ends. Investment, emigration and labour force growth start returning to baseline values between 2013 and 2017. GDP per capita and tax revenues start returning to baseline around 2040. Education variables do not return to baseline without additional effort.},

@article{Athey2015,
abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

abstract = {Industrial development often requires investment in machinery and factory buildings. When one is facing credit constraints, the conventional thinking is to borrow from formal or informal sources. In the early stage of industrialization, lack of financial development is more common than not in developing countries. Vast rural areas in coastal China have become industrialized at an unprecedented speed and have been able to produce a wide range of manufactured goods. This paper is a case study of only one industry in one area of China. The authors objective is not to test the causal role of financial development on industrial growth but rather to demonstrate that clustering can add to the possibilities of industrialization. Section II reviews the evolution of the Puyuan cashmere sweater industrial cluster. Section III explains the two business models of production and their survey sampling method. Section IV documents capital entry barriers among different types of production.},

abstract = {This study focuses on which agricultural subsectors are important in Ethiopia's economic growth and poverty reduction and what kind of agricultural and nonagricultural growth is needed to achieve the millennium development goal of halving the incidence of poverty by 2015. A spatially disaggregated, economy-wide model was developed, enabling the analysis of growth and poverty reduction linkages at national and regional levels using national household surveys, agricultural sample surveys, geographic information systems, and other national and regional data. The study reveals that agriculture can play a central role in decreasing poverty and increasing growth in Ethiopia. Within the agriculture, growth in cereals and other staple crops should receive priority. Agricultural growth also requires concurrent investments in roads and other market conditions. At the subnational level, similar growth rates within agricultural subsectors have different effects on poverty, necessitating regionally based strategies for growth and poverty reduction. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

U.S. multinational affiliates increase sales, assets and investment significantly more than local firms during, and subsequent to, currency crises. The enhanced relative performance of multinationals is traced to their ability to use internal capital markets to capitalize on the competitiveness benefits of large depreciations. Investment specifications indicate that increases in leverage resulting from sharp depreciations constrain local firms from capitalizing on these investment opportunities, but do not constrain multinational affiliates. Multinational parents also infuse new capital in their affiliates after currency crises. These results indicate another role for foreign direct investment in emerging markets multinational affiliates expand economic activity during currency crises when local firms are most constrained"--NBER website},

The BACHUE model is a long-run economic-demographic model of the Philippines and the Adelman-Robinson model is a medium-term computable general equilibrium model of Korea. In spite of differences in focus and design, the two models yield similar conclusions. Although the size distribution of income is quite stable and hard to change, it is possible to achieve egalitarian development strategies with integrated, comprehensive sets of policies. However, the distribution of income by socioeconomic groups (an extended functional distribution) is much more sensitive to policy interventions, indicating the need to integrate economic and political analysis of distribution policies. In any case, a general equilibrium analysis is important since indirect effects are often crucial in determining the ultimate impact of a policy intervention.},

Some aquaculture systems also reduce wild fish supplies through habitat modification, wild seedstock collection and other ecological impacts. On balance, global aquaculture production still adds to world fish supplies; however, if the growing aquaculture industry is to sustain its contribution to world fish supplies, it must reduce wild fish inputs in feed and adopt more ecologically sound management practices.},

Although government-implemented cash transfer schemes have gained popularity throughout Latin America, these schemes are just emerging in Africa. While where there is evidence of the beneficial impact of cash transfers on food security from Latin American countries, there is a dearth of evidence from resource poor countries in Africa. In order to fill this gap, we conducted a longitudinal, randomized community control study of the pilot SCTS in Mchinji, Malawi from March 2007 to April 2008. In this study, we describe the impact of approximately US{\$}14 per month on food security among recipient households compared to control households using indicators of food consumption and expenditures and dietary diversity. We present compelling evidence, whereby each of the tested outcomes yields large effect sizes that are highly statistically significant, demonstrating a sizeable impact of cash transfers on food security and food diversity in rural Malawi. The SCTS appears to be an effective tool within the National Social Welfare Policy for improving food security in the country's destitute households.},

But transaction costs estimates are not always available, or where available, are cumbersome to use and expensive to purchase. We present a model that requires only the time series of daily security returns to endogenously estimate the effective transaction costs for any firm, exchange, or time period. The feature of the data that allows for the estimation of transaction costs is the incidence of zero returns. Incorporating zero returns in the return-generating process, the model provides continuous estimates of average round-trip transaction costs from 1963 to 1990 that are 1.2{\%} and 10.3{\%} for large and small decile firms, respectively. These estimates are highly correlated (85{\%}), with the most commonly used transaction cost estimators.},

Most of this attention has focused on forms of the activity commonly referred to as ‘small-scale'.

I use instrumental variables techniques to explore the effects of seasonal migration on agricultural production in rural Vietnam during the 1990s. Using network variables specific to Vietnam as instruments, I find that migrant households in north Vietnam appear to move out of rice production and into the production of other crops. Inputs used by migrant households decrease relative to similar non-migrant households. The evidence is consistent with a shift from labor intensive into land-intensive crops, rather than productivity changes or the use of additional capital in production. I.},

This issue is of broader relevance to developing countries that may be contemplating the use of World Trade Organisation permissible trade barriers so as to achieve a domestic policy objective. The model predicts that gross domestic product would be unaffected while real private consumption falls. The real exchange rate appreciates while unemployment levels are unaffected. Food, other manufactures, trade and hotels are the clear losers. All other industries experience small positive gains or no impact on their output. The impact on households depends on their factor endowments and their consumption patterns. The impacts on poverty reduction are very small. Poverty indicators increase more in urban areas than in rural areas. Poverty increases slightly more among Asian households, followed by White and then Coloured households. African households experience small declines in poverty.},

abstract = {Consider the problem of estimating the entries of a large matrix, when the observed entries are noisy versions of a small random fraction of the original entries. This problem has received widespread attention in recent times, especially after the pioneering works of Emmanuel Candes and collaborators. Typically, it is assumed that the underlying matrix has low rank. This paper introduces a simple estimation procedure, called Universal Singular Value Thresholding (USVT), that works for any matrix that has `a little bit of structure'. In particular, the matrix need not be of low rank. The procedure is very simple and fast, works under minimal assumptions, and is applicable for very large matrices. Surprisingly, this simple estimator achieves the minimax error rate up to a constant factor. The method is applied to give simple solutions to difficult questions in low rank matrix estimation, blockmodels, distance matrix completion, latent space models, positive definite matrix completion, problems related to graph limits, and generalized Bradley-Terry models for pairwise comparison.},

abstract = {Over the past five decades in the United States, total medical expenditures and the proportion of medical expenditures financed with public funds have both increased significantly. A substantial increase in the prevalence of obesity has contributed to this growth. In this study we measure the external cost of obesity in the form of publicly funded health-care expenditures, and how this cost changes when the distribution of obesity in the population changes. We use a continuous measure of obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI), rather than discrete BMI categories to represent the distribution of obesity and changes in it. We predict that a one-unit increase in BMI for every adult in the United States would increase annual public medical expenditures by {\$}6.0 billion. This estimated public cost equates to an average marginal cost of {\$}27 per year, per adult for a one-unit increase in BMI for each adult in the U.S. population—or {\$}4.35 per pound. Separately, we estimate that if every U.S. adult who is now obese (BMI ≥30) had a BMI of 25 instead, annual public medical expenditures would decline by {\$}166.2 billion (in constant 2009 dollars), or 15.2{\%} of annual public medical expenditures in 2009. Assuming a socially optimal BMI of no more than 25, we estimate that the prevalence of obesity in 2009 resulted in a deadweight loss of {\$}148.2 billion in 2009.},

The model is capable of systematically representing broad land covers and allocating agricultural area to the country relevant crops. We apply the model to assess the potential environmental impacts of road development in the country. Results indicate that an ongoing plan for road network expansion in the country would cause a reduction of more than 2 {\%} in the existing forest resources, an increase of about 16 {\%} in the current agricultural land, and a total loss of carbon stock estimated to be 316 TgC. The DRC government should consider forest protection a priority as road development is promoted. A plan for agricultural intensification could be safely pursued if coupled with necessary resources to prevent deforestation.},

There have been major changes in the past, including the introduction of computers and magnetically encoded checks, but the complex range of new equipment, organizations, and services, which goes under the banner heading of electronic funds transfer systems (EFTS), can literally be called a technological revolution. This article reviews the major choices presented by EFTS. It describes and analyzes some of the problems that have beset the innovators and suggests consumer-oriented approaches that bankers can use in deciding what EFT system, if any, is likely to prove successful for their institution. Although the discussion is limited to banks, it is relevant to any industry that is in the midst of massive technological advances involving the public. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Yet few discussions of consumer allocation over time give this problem due consideration. Marshall and Fisher were both aware of the uncertainty of survival, but for one reason or another they did not expound on how a consumer might be expected to react to this uncertainty if he is to behave "rationally". Other theorists seem to disregard the problem altogether. In the present discussion we intend to go to the other extreme, by concentrating entirely on the uncertainty of lifetime and ignoring the other uncertainties which a consumer must normally cope with. The uncertainty of future earnings, for instance, will enter the discussion only insofar as the flow of earnings stops when the consumer dies.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the treatment of technological change (TC) in economic models of environmental policy. Numerous economic modeling studies have confirmed the sensitivity of mid- and long-run climate change mitigation cost and benefit projections to assumptions about technology costs. In general, technical progress is considered to be a non-economic, exogenous variable in global climate change modeling. However, there is overwhelming evidence that TC is not an exogenous variable but to an important degree endogenous, induced by needs and pressures. Hence, some energy-economy-environment models treat TC as endogenous, responding to socio-economic variables. Three main elements in models of technological innovation are: (i) corporate investment in research and development (R{\&}D), (ii) spillovers from R{\&}D, and (iii) technology learning, especially learning-by-doing. The incorporation of induced TC in different types of energy-environmental-economic models tends to reduce the costs of environmental policy, accelerates abatement and may lead to positive spillover and negative leakage.},

abstract = {Using a census survey of households in Guizhou Province, this paper examines the patterns of village poverty and inequality and their major correlates. The results show that poverty incidences vary greatly among villages and inequality is relatively high within villages in these impoverished areas. Although agriculture is still the major source of livelihood in this inland western region, income from local nonfarm jobs and remittance is more unevenly distributed and accounts for the largest share of overall income inequality. Surprisingly, blood donation is another major source of cash income. On the expenditure side, health care was found to be one of the most important sources of inequality. The paper also found that the distribution of assets, particularly land holdings, contributes to overall income inequality. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size?$\backslash$"high-dimensional data$\backslash$"?are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in $\backslash$"data mining$\backslash$"? can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term $\backslash$"data mining$\backslash$" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for $\backslash$"true$\backslash$" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

Results suggest that in the short and medium term, an increase in a country's level of income inequality has a significant positive relationship with subsequent economic growth.

In the last few years CES production functions have become more important in economic modelling, especially for applied general equilibrium models where CES production functions are an important building stone. In the literature, different results of estimated elasticities can be found. This paper investigates three different approaches for nested CES production functions and their estimated substitution elasticities. Capital, energy and labour are estimated as substitutes for the West German industry in the long run.},

@article{Kun2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and assess determinants related to PTSD symptoms among adult earthquake survivors after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional multicluster sample surveys with data collected from four counties.

METHODS: Surveys were conducted separately in four counties in Sichuan Province, with a total of 2004 respondents. Beichuan County and Dujiangyan City were damaged more severely than Yaan County and Langzhong County during the earthquake. In total, 1890 households were represented, with a mean of 2.2 respondents per household. Data were collected using structured interviews, and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria were used to diagnose PTSD.

RESULTS: The prevalence rates of suspected PTSD were 47.3{\%} (n = 436) in heavily damaged areas and 10.4{\%} (n = 93) in moderately damaged areas. The prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms among elderly, middle aged and young adults were 55.8{\%}, 50.2{\%} and 28.6{\%} (P = 0.001), respectively, in heavily damaged areas. Older age, female gender, unmarried/divorced/widowed, ethnic minority, death of family member, no household income and damaged household were independent risk factors for PTSD symptoms in heavily damaged areas.

CONCLUSION: Interventions designed to reduce PTSD among populations affected by the 2008 earthquake should focus on people without household incomes, those with damaged households and those who experienced the death of a family member. Effective, sustainable and culturally sensitive psychosocial interventions and mental health services are required, and attention should be directed to survivors who experienced the death of a family member, women and older adults following the devastating natural disaster. Governments should support income-generating activities and improve living conditions. Trained field personnel can assist with PTSD assessments and referrals, and existing rural healthcare services can be used to provide treatment for common psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {We use a randomized controlled trial to study the response of poor households in rural Kenya to large, unconditional cash transfers from the NGO GiveDirectly. The transfers differ from other programs in that they are explicitly unconditional, large, and concentrated in time. We randomized at both the village and household levels; further, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife vs. husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer vs. monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (USD 404 PPP vs. USD 1,525 PPP). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from USD 158 PPP to USD 193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological wellbeing. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, while lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on economic outcomes and psychological wellbeing.},

@article{Collier2014,
abstract = {For economic development to succeed in Africa in the next 50years, African agriculture will have to change beyond recognition. Production will have to have increased massively, but also labor productivity, requiring a vast reduction in the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture and a large move out of rural areas. The paper questions how this can be squared with a continuing commitment to smallholder agriculture as the main route for growth in African agriculture and for poverty reduction. We question the evidence base for an exclusive focus on smallholders, and argue for a much more open-minded approach to different modes of production. To allow alternative modes and scale of production to emerge, new institutional and policy frameworks are required. A rush to establish “mega-farms” with government discretionary allocation of vast tracts of land is unlikely to be the answer. Allowing a more dynamic agriculture to develop will require clear institutional frameworks, and not just a narrow focus on smallholders.},

abstract = {In this paper we review the available summary measures for the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in health. Measures which have been used differ in a number of important respects, including (1) the measurement of “relative” or “absolute” differences; (2) the measurement of an “effect” of lower socio-economic status, or of the “total impact” of socio-economic inequalities in-health upon the health status of the population; (3) simple versus sophisticated measurement techniques. Based on this analysis of summary measures which have previously been applied, eight different classes of summary measures can be distinguished. Because measures of “total impact” can be further subdivided on the basis of their underlying assumptions, we finally arrive at 12 types of summary measure. Each of these has its merits, and choice of a particular type of summary measure will depend partly on technical considerations, partly on one's perspective on socio-economic inequalities in health. In practice, it will often be useful to compare the results of several summary measures. These principles are illustrated with two examples: one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in mortality by occupational class in Finland, and one on trends in the magnitude of inequalities in self-reported morbidity by level of education in the Netherlands.},

We use it to simulate the impacts on rural welfare of market price supports, production subsidies, input subsidies, and the removal of transaction costs. Applications to six countries demonstrate the diversity of potential impacts, exhibit some systemic differences compared with impacts in developed countries, and identify specific circumstances under which market interventions may be only slightly less efficient than direct payments at transferring incomes to rural households.},

A selectivity model endogenously switches households into alternative market participation states, correcting for bias caused by the exclusion of unobservable variables affecting both discrete and continuous decisions. Improved market information increases the probability of participation by sellers, while access to cereals-processing technology increases quantities transacted by both sellers and buyers, conditional on participation.},

abstract = {Does access to off-farm income complement or compete with agricultural production ? This article explores the effect of off-farm income on agricultural production activities, using data from the 2003 Mexico National Rural Household Survey. We first discuss the theoretical conditions under which access to off-farm income may influence production in an agricultural household model. Instrumental-variable (IV) estimation methods are then used to test whether agricultural production activities, technologies, and input use differ between households with and without access to off-farm income. We find that off-farm income has a negative effect on agricultural output and the use of family labor on the farm, but a positive impact on the demand for purchased inputs. There is also a slight efficiency gain in households with access to off-farm income. Findings offer insights into how household production evolves as rural households increasingly engage in off-farm income activities.},

abstract = {Summary In this review, we describe changes in dynamics of HIV transmission and shifts in affected populations in western Europe using HIV/AIDS surveillance data and published and unpublished reports. Despite substantial reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral treatment, HIV continues to pose a major public health problem in western Europe. More than half a million people are living with an infection that remains incurable and requires costly lifelong treatment; many people remain unaware of their infection, and thousands of new infections continue to occur every year. Migrants from countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, notably sub-Saharan Africa, bear a disproportionate and increasing share of HIV throughout western Europe and, in most countries, account for the majority of heterosexually acquired HIV infections diagnosed in recent years. Prevention, treatment, and care must be adapted to reach migrant populations. Following a resurgence of risky sexual behaviour, HIV transmission may now be increasing among homosexual and bisexual men, and renewed safer sex campaigns are urgently needed.},

abstract = {The neoclassical theory of demand applies to individuals, yet in empirical work it is usually taken as valid for households with many members. This paper explores what the theory of individuals implies for households that have more than one member. We make minimal assumptions about how the individual members of the household resolve conflicts. All we assume is that however decisions are made, outcomes are efficient. We refer to this as the collective setting. We show that in the collective setting household demands must satisfy a symmetry and rank condition on the Slutsky matrix. We also present some further results on the effects on demands of variables that do not modify preferences but that do affect how decisions are made. We apply our theory to a series of surveys of household expenditures from Canada. The tests of the usual symmetry conditions are rejected for two-person households but not for one-person households. We also show that income pooling is rejected for two-person households. We then test for our collective setting conditions on the couples data. None of the collective setting restrictions are rejected. We conclude that the collective setting is a plausible and tractable next step to take in the analysis of household behavior.},

We link recent production trends to household incomes using a regionalized, recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium and microsimulation model. Results indicate some inconsistency between recent growth and poverty measurements in Tanzania. We also find that the structure of economic growth may have constrained the rate of poverty reduction. Agricultural growth has been driven by larger-scale farmers who are less likely to be poor; and has been concentrated among crops grown in specific regions of the country. Slow expansion of food crops and livestock also explain the weak relationship between agricultural growth and nutrition outcomes. We find that accelerating agricultural growth, particularly in maize, strengthens the growth–poverty relationship and enhances households' caloric availability, while also contributing significantly to growth itself.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on catastrophic medical payments of rural households in Linyi County, Shandong Province.

METHOD: In 2005, from a stratified cluster sample of 3101 rural households, we identified 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments by searching through NCMS claims and interviewing key informants. We interviewed these 375 households and confirmed that 231 had had catastrophic payments ({\textgreater} or = 40{\%} of the households' capacity to pay; CTP) during 2004. A validity test of our screening method found another eight cases among immediate neighbours of these 375 households; by extrapolation, we obtained an adjusted total of 289 catastrophic households in the sample of 3101. We measured the impact of the NCMS on hardship alleviation by counterfactual analysis, comparing catastrophic payments before and after NCMS reimbursements.

RESULT: The effect was twofold. Before NCMS intervention 8.98{\%} of Linyi population had had catastrophic out-of-pocket payments compared with 8.25{\%} after reimbursements. Catastrophic severity for households remaining in catastrophe after reimbursement dropped by 18.7{\%} to an average of 6.34 times the household's CTP.

CONCLUSION: Out-of-pocket medical payments remain a burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS, with an average reimbursement of 17.8{\%}, was modest and should be restructured to provide better benefits that are targeted to those in most need.},

The many aspects of our lives that are governed by social networks make it critical to understand how they impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do. In Social and Economic Networks, Matthew Jackson offers a comprehensive introduction to social and economic networks, drawing on the latest findings in economics, sociology, computer science, physics, and mathematics. He provides empirical background on networks and the regularities that they exhibit, and discusses random graph-based models and strategic models of network formation. He helps readers to understand behavior in networked societies, with a detailed analysis of learning and diffusion in networks, decision making by individuals who are influenced by their social neighbors, game theory and markets on networks, and a host of related subjects. Jackson also describes the varied statistical and modeling techniques used to analyze social networks. Each chapter includes exercises to aid students in their analysis of how networks function. This book is an indispensable resource for students and researchers in economics, mathematics, physics, sociology, and business.},

A stratified random sampling strategy was used to survey 2080 adult survivors of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Job Satisfaction Index Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale were used in the assessment of the posttraumatic growth, work satisfaction and perceived stress respectively, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used for the analysis. The findings highlight work satisfaction as an important factor in both the prediction of posttraumatic growth and for its moderating effect on perceived stress. Some demographic characteristics, such as gender, education level, and housing condition were found to also affect the survivors' posttraumatic growth. This conclusion indicates that managers should pay closer attention to their employees' psychological state after a disaster and medical practitioners should consider survivors' work status and perceived stress when dispensing mental health care.},

In the past, nonemployed mothers' time with children was reduced by the demands of unpaid family work and domestic chores and by the use of mother substitutes for childcare, especially in large families. Today employed mothers seek ways to maximize time with children: They remain quite likely to work part-time or to exit from the labor force for some years when their children are young; they also differ from nonemployed mothers in other uses of time (housework, volunteer work, leisure). In addition, changes in children's lives (e.g., smaller families, the increase in preschool enrollment, the extended years of financial dependence on parents as more attend college) are altering the time and money investments that children require from parents. Within marriage, fathers are spending more time with their children than in the past, perhaps increasing the total time children spend with parents even as mothers work more hours away from home.},

As research on Internet consumer behavior is still in its infancy, a quantitative framework to characterize user profiles for e-commerce has not yet been established. This study proposes a quantitative framework that uses factor analysis to identify latent factor descriptors of Internet users' opinions on Web vendors and on-line shopping. Predictive models based on logistic discrimination and neural networks then select the factors most predictive of the propensity to buy on-line and classify Internet users accordingly. The application of this framework shows that the obtained latent factors agree in general with the major indicators identified in previous qualitative research. A small subset of the obtained factors is shown to retain the predictive power of the whole set.

Despite small farm sizes, high land fragmentation, and wage escalation, agricultural production in China has steadily increased in the past. In response to a rising wage rate, the most power-intensive stages of agricultural production, such as land preparation and harvesting, have been increasingly outsourced to special service providers. Rural households were facing farm-level labor constraints, in particular during the agricultural peak seasons, before these constraints translated into a significant tightening of the farm labor market. From the supply side, there had been a sharp substitution of animal traction with machines. Animals used for traction, per 100 farm families, dropped from about 55 in 1985 to only 20 in 2009. Moreover, both the small machine and large machine stocks developed quickly. Tens of thousands of private mechanization service providers travel throughout the country to harvest crops.},

The utilization of these services is disappointingly low, however, despite high numbers reporting that they would like to be tested. Explanations of this discrepancy typically rely on responses to hypothetical questions posed in terms of psychological or social barriers; often, the explanation is that people fear learning that they are infected with a disease that they understand to be fatal and stigmatizing. Yet when we offered door-to-door rapid blood testing for HIV as part of a longitudinal study in rural Malawi, the overwhelming majority agreed to be tested and to receive their results immediately. Thus, in this paper, we ask: why are more people not getting tested? Using an explanatory research design, we find that rural Malawians are responsive to door-to-door HIV testing for the following reasons: it is convenient, confidential, and the rapid blood test is credible. Our study suggests that attention to these factors in VCT strategies may mitigate the fear of HIV testing, and ultimately increase uptake in rural African settings.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in rural areas in China is characterized by high consumption of fuelwood, straw and other biomass. Off-farm employment can play an important role in the transition towards more sustainable sources of energy by increasing rural household incomes and reducing the amount of labor available for biomass collection. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of off-farm employment on rural household energy consumption choices, and to disentangle the various causal relationships that play a role in this respect. To this end, a hybrid farm household/village computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used that has been calibrated for a remote village in Northeast Jiangxi Province where fuelwood is the main source of energy. The model takes into account nonseparability of farm household production and consumption decisions as well as linkages within the village between households involved in off-farm employment and households with no members working off-farm. Contrary to previous research for a richer region in rural China, we find that fuelwood is not an inferior good. The positive impact of more food consumption on fuelwood collection more than compensates the higher leisure demand associated with higher incomes. Shifts in production activities and in prices on village factor markets caused by increased labour scarcity (the lost-labour effect of off-farm employment), on the other hand, cause a reduction in fuelwood collection and consumption. This lost-labour effect is much stronger for migration than for local off-farm employment, because the latter can more easily be combined with on-farm work and fuelwood collection. For local off-farm employment the income effect dominates the lost-labour effect, resulting in a positive overall impact of higher off-farm participation on fuelwood consumption. For migration, on the other hand, the income effect and the lost-labour effect are almost equal in size. Hence, the amount of fuelwood collected and consumed does not change much when households participate in migration. The final conclusion is therefore that increased off-farm employment opportunities do not promote the transition of rural energy use in the poorer regions of rural China.},

However, subsidizing goods on which households spend a high proportion of their budget can create large wealth effects. Consumers may then substitute towards foods with higher non-nutritional attributes (e.g., taste), but lower nutritional content per unit of currency, weakening or perhaps even reversing the subsidy's intended impact. We analyze data from a randomized program of large price subsidies for poor households in two provinces of China and find no evidence that the subsidies improved nutrition. In fact, it may have had a negative impact for some households. (JEL I38; O12; Q18).},

@article{Barrios2008b,
abstract = {This paper proposes a household model that relates various development interventions, such as infrastructure, to rural development. The model is then estimated using data from a household survey in which rural development outcomes are measured in terms of a perception scale. Household perceptions are important early lead indicators of rural development outcomes that manifest later. Rural poverty is linked to the exposure of the households to economic vulnerability, through their chronic dependence on agriculture for income generation. A starting point in mitigating this vulnerability would be a comprehensive improvement in accessibility. This would substantially reduce transportation cost and thereby lessen the isolation of rural communities from basic welfare services. An advocacy campaign and/or incentive system would be needed to encourage private firms to establish operations in rural areas. More private establishments in rural areas would not only shield households against exposure to vulnerability, but would also serve as a catalyst for microenterprise development. Sustainable rural development would follow, provided that there was an ample corporate social responsibility programme among these firms to avert a widening of inequality. A natural resource management strategy would also be needed for ecological integrity. Community participation is crucial in identifying development projects; it can help to minimise the wastage of resources on inappropriate projects, and enable resources to be allocated instead it to other productive uses. The provision of rural roads should be bundled properly with support services and capacity-building activities. This can enhance the demand for other infrastructure and services, resulting in a dynamic evolution of essential elements in the pursuit of rural development. Bundles of intervention improve the production efficiency of rural households at the different stages of production, both on and off the farm. Rural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable segments of the community, especially, the farmers. Interventions should aim gradually to detach them from complete dependence on agriculture, without putting their food security at risk. Public investments in infrastructure and in users' fees can complement each other, in the continuous provision of new infrastructure and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, to create a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialised users' fee system is a potential tool for preventing widening income disparity in rural areas. The careful selection of a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialised users' fee rate is important, however. An incorrect choice of rate could be perceived as a disincentive to access or might stimulate distrust among a segment of the rural society, regarding the government's sincerity in promoting rural development. This might eventually create more social issues, rather than bridging inequality.},

We examine the interaction of these two effects in the context of a dynamic Keynesian growth cycle model and assess the likelihood of a structurally adjusting economy experiencing a recovery through feminization. Our analysis shows that for a gender-based recovery to succeed, the impact of feminization of the labor force on investment must be stronger than the impact a rising intensity of female household labor has on savings. Our analysis shows that high and high middleincome countries are more likely to benefit from feminization processes.},

In the academic literature, website quality has generally been recognized as a critical step to drive business online. As such, numerous studies have been devoted to website quality and evaluations. Research efforts are, however, in need of understanding the use of websites in regards to online customers' behavior, especially Chinese customers. This study developed and empirically tested a conceptual model of the impact of website quality on customer satisfaction and purchase intentions. Results indicated that website quality has a direct and positive impact on customer satisfaction, and that customer satisfaction has a direct and positive impact on purchase intentions. While the influence of website quality on purchase intentions exists, customer satisfaction does significantly mediate this effect. Drawing on the empirical findings, managerial implications and recommendations for future research are offered. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {From the perspective of traditional labor-exporting communities in rural Mexico, this article examines how the 1986 US Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) has affected perceptions of the US labor market, the propensity to migrate, settlement patterns in the United States, and the economies of migrant families and their home communities. The analysis draws upon sample survey interviews conducted in 1988-89 in three communities located in the states of Jalisco, Michoacan, and Zacatecas. The data reveal that most residents--including prospective first-time undocumented migrants to the United States--continue to view US labor markets as relatively accessible, with or without legal entry documents, even though employer sanctions have increased the perceived difficulty of finding work in the United States. IRCA-mandated legalization programs have augmented the total flow of US-bound migrants from traditional sending communities, while sharply reducing the relative size of the undocumented component. through its "amnesty" programs, the 1986 law is also increasing the representation of women and children in the migrant flow and accelerating the shift from temporary or shuttle migration to permanent settlement in the United States.},

abstract = {A Randomized Evaluation is a type of Impact Evaluation that uses random assignment to allocate resources, run
programs, or apply policies as part of the study design. Like all impact evaluations, the main purpose of randomized
evaluations is to determine whether a program has an impact, and more specifically, to quantify how large that impact is.
Impact evaluations measure program effectiveness typically by comparing outcomes of those (individuals, communities,
schools, etc.) who received the program against those who did not. There are many methods of doing this. But
randomized evaluations are generally considered the most rigorous and, all else equal, produce the most accurate (i.e.
unbiased) results.

@article{Kahneman1979a,
abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Fisheries and aquaculture play important roles in providing food and income in many developing countries, either as a stand-alone activity or in association with crop agriculture and livestock rearing. The aim of this paper is to identify how these contributions of fisheries and aquaculture to poverty reduction and food security can be enhanced while also addressing the need for a sustainability transition in over-exploited and over-capitalized capture fisheries, and for improved environmental performance and distributive justice in a rapidly growing aquaculture sector. The focus of the paper is on the poverty and food security concerns of developing countries, with an emphasis on the least developed. It is therefore most relevant to the OECD states' roles as donors, signatories to multilateral agreements relevant to fisheries and food security, and as trading partners with developing countries. The emphasis is on food security rather than poverty reduction policies and strategies, although the two are of course related. The food security agenda is very much to the fore at present; fish prices rose along with other food prices in 2007-8 and as fish provide important nutritional benefits to the poor, food security has become a primary concern for sector policy. After examining the evolving food security policy context, the paper articulates pathways linking the fisheries sector with poverty reduction and food security. The main analytical section then examines: 1. The poverty and food security implications of a restructuring of global fisheries to improve sectoral economic performance, through capacity reduction and rights-based management. 2. The links between domestic food security and policies to increase fish exports from both capture fisheries and aquaculture, to contribute to GDP growth. 3. The relative benefits to food security from policies favouring the development of small-scale and larger-scale aquaculture. Finally, recommendations are made to ensure that fisheries sector policy reform supports the need to sustainably reduce levels of poverty and hunger, not just among those employed in the sector, but among populations of developing countries where fisheries and aquaculture are important sources of revenue and food.},

@article{Card1990,
abstract = {Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7{\%}, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.},

The role of fragmentation in direct mass spectrometric sequencing schemes and as a limitation for the accessible mass range in nucleic acid MALDI mass spectrometry is discussed.},

As a result, less money is remitted home to Mexico, and more is spent in the United States. These trends give rise to a steady, cumulative increase in the probability of U.S. settlement.},

Assuming these are addressed the country could reduce its CO2 intensity by a third before costs outweigh environmental co-benefits. By contrast a cap confined to the manufacturing and power sector does not bring substantial co-benefits to China.},

The paper describes the context for the PSNP in Ethiopia, the design and operational mechanisms of the program in 2009, provides evidence of the impact and efficiency of the program, and discusses the thematic areas at length. Design issues that occurred in 2004 are explained, and followed by critical reflection on implementation from 2005-2009.

Estimating the model across 949 farmers in seven countries, we find that both temperature and precipitation affect the crops that South American farmers choose. Farmers choose fruits and vegetables in warmer locations and wheat and potatoes in cooler locations. Farms in wetter locations are more likely to grow rice, fruits, potatoes, and squash and in dryer locations maize and wheat. Global warming will cause South American farmers to switch away from maize, wheat, and potatoes towards squash, fruits and vegetables. Predictions of the impact of climate change on net revenue must reflect not only changes in yields per crop but also crop switching. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A survey has been undertaken to examine long-term psychological after-effects of a devastating earthquake (the Tangshan earthquake) in China in 1976. Subjects (equal number of males and females, aged between 20 and 70) consisted of 110 paraplegic and 100 non-deformed persons. The 16-PF Questionnaire, two attitude tests and individual interviews were used in the investigation. Results show that the earthquake had long-term effects on people's minds. The effects are extensive and long-lasting, and differed between different groups. This indicates that in the study of the impact of Global Change on humans, earthquake disasters should be brought into focus, not only as physical disasters but also with reference to the psychological shock caused by an earthquake.},

I explore these questions by testing hypotheses about the effects of apprehension on the actual and desired length of stay in the United States and on the frequency of migration for undocumented Mexican male migrants. Results suggest that INS policy may well be backfiring. Migrants stay in the United States longer on non-apprehended trips and stay in Mexico for shorter spells between trips to compensate for the cost of a past apprehension.},

In this paper, after first reviewing prospect theory and the difficulties inherent in applying it, I discuss some of this recent work. While it is too early to declare this research effort an unqualified success, the rapid progress of the last decade makes me optimistic that at least some of the insights of prospect theory will eventually find a permanent and significant place in mainstream economic analysis.},

abstract = {The number of people buying and selling products online in China has grown from practically zero in 2000 to more than 400 million by 2015. Most of this growth has occurred in cities. In this context, the Chinese government recently announced the expansion of e-commerce to the countryside as a policy priority with the objective to close the rural-urban economic divide. As part of this agenda, the government entered a partnership with a large Chinese e-commerce firm. The program invests in the necessary transport logistics to ship products to and sell prod-ucts from tens of thousands of villages that were largely unconnected to e-commerce. The firm also installs an e-commerce terminal at a central village location, where a terminal manager assists households in buying and selling products through the firm's e-commerce platform. This paper combines a new collection of survey and transaction microdata with a randomized control trial (RCT) across villages that we implement in collaboration with the e-commerce firm. We use this empirical setting to provide evidence on the potential of e-commerce inte-gration to foster economic development in the countryside, the underlying channels and the distribution of the gains from e-commerce across households and villages.

We find that increases in neighbors' wealth strongly decrease life satisfaction and moderately decrease consumption and asset holdings. The decrease in life satisfaction induced by transfers to neighbors more than offsets the direct positive effect of transfers, and is largest for individuals who did not receive a direct transfer themselves. We find evidence of hedonic adaptation, in that the negative spillover effect of transfers to neighbors decreases over time, at a rate similar to that of direct transfers.},

abstract = {Factor VIIa/tissue factor (FVIIa/TF) interaction has been reported to induce intracellular signalling in cells constitutively expressing TF, independently of downstream activation of the coagulation cascade. It is unknown, however, whether binding of FVII to its cofactor TF alters the gene expression profile in cells which inducible express TF under inflammatory conditions. To address this issue, gene expression patterns in cultured LPS-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages with or without exposure to FVIIa were compared by cDNA macro-array analysis. Of the 1176 genes examined on the array, a small set of six genes (IL-6, IL-8,TNF-a, GRO-beta alpha-thymosin, cathepsin H) were consistently up-regulated and one gene suppressed (alpha-antitrypsin) in response to FVIIa in activated monocyte-derived macrophages. Among the seven genes identified by array analysis, five genes were finally confirmed by real-time RT PCR. Interestingly, all of these genes differentially regulated in response to FVIIa (GRO-beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and alpha-antitrypsin) are critical in inflammation. The changes in gene expression were reflected by corresponding changes in the protein concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 as demonstrated by ELISA .Active site-inhibited FVIIa had no effect on gene expression indicating that FVIIa-induced gene alteration is dependent on the proteolytic activity of FVIIa. The FVIIa-induced alterations in gene expression were found to be TF-dependent but independent of downstream coagulation proteins like thrombin and FXa. In summary, this study demonstrates that binding of FVIIa to its cofactor TF enhances restricted pro-inflammatory genes in activated monocyte-derived macrophages. By up-regulation of chemokines critical for leukocyte recruitment, FVIIa/TF interaction on activated monocyte-derived macrophages could be relevant to prepare monocytes/macrophages for extravasation and may represent a novel amplification loop of leukocyte recruitment.},

abstract = {Almeida E. S. de, Haddad E. A. and Hewings G. J. D. Transport?regional equity issue revisited, Regional Studies. The objective of this paper is to analyse the relationship between transport and regional equity in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Furthermore, the existence of a trade-off between economic performance and regional equity is investigated as well. To do so, the paper develops a spatial computable general equilibrium model based on Br{\"{o}}cker and Schneider's approach of 2002 to implement comparative static analysis, explicitly incorporating iceberg transportation costs. Four activities are modelled, namely production, final demand, transportation and exports. Two production factors are assumed: labour and other factors. The model has 12 domestic regions and three external regions. Four counterfactual experiments are developed based on decreases in transportation costs due to a ?distance shortening?. The main findings indicate that if the transport infrastructure improvement is focused only among poor regions, the promotion of regional equity is insignificant. If the transport infrastructure improvement links are concentrated among rich regions, there is an increase in regional income inequalities. However, if the improvements are targeted to the roads linking poor regions and rich ones, there is greater promotion of regional equity. The same result will occur when improvements are made to all road links of the state. Almeida E. S. de, Haddad E. A. et Hewings G. J. D.

Dieser Aufsatz beabsichtigt, die Beziehung zwischen Verkehrswesen und regionaler Fairness in Minas Gerais (Brasilien) zu analysieren und zugleich auch das Vorkommen von Einbu{\ss}en entweder bei wirtschaftlicher Leistung oder regionaler Fairness zu untersuchen. Zu diesem Zwecke wird ein auf dem Ansatz von Br{\"{o}}cker und Schneider (2002) aufbauendes r{\"{a}}umliches komputables allgemeines Gleichgewichtsmodell entwickelt, um vergleichende statistische Analysen durchzuf{\"{u}}hren, wobei verborgene ?Eisberg?-Transportkosten ausdr{\"{u}}cklich ber{\"{u}}cksichtigt werden. Es werden vier Unternehmenst{\"{a}}tigk eiten aufgef{\"{u}}hrt: Herstellung, Nachfrage, Transportwesen und Exporte, und zwei Produktionsfaktoren vorausgesetzt: Arbeitskr{\"{a}}fte und andere Faktoren. Das Modell umfasst zw{\"{o}}lf Inlandsregionen und drei externe Regionen. Es werden vier gegens{\"{a}}tzliche Experimente entwickelt, die auf einer Abnahme der Transportkosten infolge einer ?Verk{\"{u}}rzung der Entfernungen? beruhen. Die Hauptbefunde weisen darauf hin, dass die F{\"{o}}rderung regionaler Fairness unbedeutend bleibt, wenn die Verbesserungen der Transportinfrastruktur sich nur auf minderbemittelte Regionen konzentrieren; werden die Verbesserungen der Verbindungen der Transportinfrastruktur in wohlhabenden Regionen durchgef{\"{u}}hrt, so nehmen regionale Einkommensunterschiede zu. Wenn die Verbesserungen jedoch auf Stra{\ss}en abzielen, die wohlhabende Regionen mit weniger bemittelten verbinden, wird regionale Fairness st{\"{a}}rker gef{\"{o}}rdert. Das gleiche Ergebnis wird sich einstellen, wenn Verbesserungen an allen Stra{\ss}enverbindungen des Staates vorgenommen werden.

Los principales resultados indican que si la mejora de la infraestructura del transporte se centra s{\'{o}}lo entre las regiones m{\'{a}}s pobres, el fomento de la igualdad regional es insignificante. Si los enlaces de la mejora de la infraestructura del transporte se concentran en las regiones ricas, aumentan las desigualdades de ingresos regionales.

El mismo resultado ocurre cuando se mejoran los enlaces de todas las carreteras del estado.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} OECD 2012. In this chapter, household production and consumption data are combined with national price data to simulate the welfare effects of increases in staple prices. The focus is on the rural sectors of nine developing countries and on six types of staple crops. The results show that since most rural households are net buyers of staples, they stand to lose from higher staple prices in the short run. However, simulations of the 2007/2008 food price crisis suggest that the magnitude and timing of the welfare shocks depended heavily on the type of crops produced and consumed by each rural household. Simulations up to 2018 suggest higher future prices threatening welfare, but also creating opportunities for those who can increase staple production.},

The general framework for empirical analysis is based on a comparison of programme beneficiaries with a group of controls interviewed in 2012 and again two years later, using difference-in-difference (or double difference) estimators combined with propensity score matching methods. The findings show that the programme significantly increased household food security and decreased the number of hours children spend on household chores and activities. The programme is also associated with increases in social capital, and subjective well-being. However, the effects of the SCTPP on the accumulation of productive assets and on agricultural production are mixed. The analysis reveals important heterogeneity in programme impacts, with estimated magnitudes varying over geographical area and over gender of the household head.},

Goods-trade liberalization yields a modest gain in aggregate welfare. Reducing service barriers generate relatively large welfare gains and low adjustment costs. Services liberalization increases economic activity in all sectors and raise the real returns to both capital and labor.

abstract = {In this paper we summarize evidence on six perceptions associated with cash transfer programming, using eight rigorous evaluations conducted on large-scale government unconditional cash transfers in sub-Saharan Africa, under the Transfer Project. Specifically, we investigate if transfers: 1) induce higher spending on alcohol or tobacco; 2) are fully consumed (rather than invested); 3) create dependency (reduce participation in productive activities); 4) increase fertility; 5) lead to negative community-level economic impacts (including price distortion and inflation), and 6) are fiscally unsustainable. We present evidence refuting each claim, leading to the conclusion that these perceptions – insofar as they are utilized in policy debates – undercut potential improvements in well-being and livelihood strengthening among the poor, which these programmes can bring about in sub-Saharan Africa, and globally. We conclude by underscoring outstanding research gaps and policy implications for the continued expansion of unconditional cash transfers in the region and beyond.},

@article{Wagstaff2003,
abstract = {This paper presents and compares two threshold approaches to measuring the fairness of health care payments, one requiring that payments do not exceed a pre-specified proportion of pre-payment income, the other that they do not drive households into poverty. We develop indices for 'catastrophe' that capture the intensity of catastrophe as well as its incidence and also allow the analyst to capture the degree to which catastrophic payments occur disproportionately among poor households. Measures of poverty impact capturing both intensity and incidence are also developed. The arguments and methods are empirically illustrated with data on out-of-pocket payments from Vietnam in 1993 and 1998. This is not an uninteresting application given that 80{\%} of health spending in that country was paid out-of-pocket in 1998. We find that the incidence and intensity of 'catastrophic' payments - both in terms of pre-payment income as well as ability to pay - were reduced between 1993 and 1998, and that both incidence and intensity of 'catastrophe' became less concentrated among the poor. We also find that the incidence and intensity of the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments diminished over the period in question. Finally, we find that the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments is primarily due to poor people becoming even poorer rather than the non-poor being made poor, and that it was not expenses associated with inpatient care that increased poverty but rather non-hospital expenditures.

abstract = {This paper uses a multi-period economic-environmental Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework to analyse local sustainability policy issues. Our focus is the small, open, labour-constrained regional economy of Jersey. The case of Jersey is of particular interest for two main reasons. The first is the unusually low degree of geographical labour market integration for such a small regional economy. This motivates our treatment of labour as a region-specific factor of production. The second is the availability of high quality, Jersey-specific economic-enviromental data. We employ CGE model simulations to track the impact of changes in population on a number of energy-consumption and pollution indicators in a recursive dynamic framework under alternative hypotheses regarding economic conditions over the time period under consideration. In the case of Jersey, we find that household consumption is the key factor governing the environmental impact of economic disturbances. Therefore the analysis includes an examination of the sensitivity of the simulation results to different assumptions affecting the wage elasticities of labour demand and supply, and the speed of adjustment to equilibrium on the responsiveness of household income to shifts in labour supply.},

abstract = {The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is a heavily subsidized voluntary health insurance program established in 2003 to reduce the risk of catastrophic health spending for rural residents in China. In this review, we present the current collection of knowledge available regarding the performance of NCMS on the aspects of revenue collection, risk pooling, reimbursement rules and provider payment. The available evidence suggests that NCMS has substantially improved health care access and utilization among the participants; however, it appears to have no statistically significant effect on average household out-of-pocket health spending and catastrophic expenditure risk. As NCMS is rolled out to other counties, it must be careful to generalize the findings reported in the published papers and reports, because the early pilot counties were not randomly selected and there are a lot of local adaptations. In addition, we expect that NCMS could be an important opportunity to establish some trust-based institutions in the best interest of the participants to monitor provider quality and control cost inflation. Rigorous evaluations, based on richer and latest micro-level data, could considerably strengthen the evidence base for the performance and impact of NCMS.},

Emerging research on globalization, market changes, poverty and trends in gendered employment within this sector reveals the need to move beyond this narrow perspective. If gleaning and post-harvesting activities were enumerated, the fisheries and aquaculture sector might well turn out to be female sphere. A livelihoods approach better enables an understanding of how employment in this sector is embedded in other social, cultural, economic, political and ecological structures and processes that shape gender inequities and how these might be reduced. We focus on four thematic areas – markets and migration, capabilities and well-being, networks and identities, governance and rights – as analytical entry points. These also provide a framework to identify research gaps and generate a comparative understanding of the impact of development processes and socioecological changes, including issues of climate change, adaptation and resilience, on gendered employment. Without an adequate analysis of gender, fisheries management and development policies may have negative effects on people's livelihoods, well-being and the environment they depend on, or fail altogether to achieve intended outcomes.},

abstract = {Three experiments investigated attentional and cognitive mechanisms in delay of gratification In each study preschool children could obtain a less preferred reward immediately or continue waiting indefinitely for a more preferred but delayed reward Experiment I compared the effects of external and cognitive distraction from the reward objects on the length of time which preschool children waited for the preferred delayed reward before forfeiting it for the sake of the less preferred immediate one. In accord with predictions from an extension of frustrative nonreward theory, children waited much longer for a preferred reward when they were distracted from the rewards than when they attended to them directly Experiment II demonstrated that only certain cognitive events (thinking "fun things") served as effective ideational dis- tractors Thinking "sad thoughts" produced short delay times, as did thinking about the rewards themselves In Experiment III the delayed rewards were not physically available for direct attention during the delay period, and the children's attention to them cogmtively was manipulated by prior instructions While the children waited, cognitions about the rewards significantly reduced, rather than enhanced, the length of their delay of gratification Overall, atten- tional and cognitive mechanisms which enhanced the salience of the rewards shortened the length of voluntary delay, while distractions from the rewards, overtly or cogmtively, facilitated delay The results permit a remterpretation of basic mechanisms in voluntary delay of gratification and self-control.},

abstract = {This paper makes a systematic comparison of four approaches to multidimensional poverty analysis based respectively on the theory of fuzzy sets, information theory, efficiency analysis and axiomatic derivations of poverty indices. The database was the 1995 Israeli Census that provided information on the ownership of various durable goods. There appears to be a fair degree of agreement between the various multidimensional poverty indices concerning the identification of the poor households. The four approaches have also shown that poverty decreases with the schooling level of the head of the household, first decreases and then increases with his/her age and with the size of the household. Poverty is higher when the head of the household is single and lower when he/she is married, lowest when the head of the household is Jewish and highest when he/she is Muslim. Poverty is also higher among households whose head immigrated in recent years, does not work or lives in Jerusalem. These observations were made on the basis of logit regressions. This impact on poverty of many of the variables is not very different from the one that is observed when poverty measurement is based only on the income or the total expenditures of the households.},

Meanwhile, more and more farmers participate in NCMS with great enthusiasm. In this study, we examined the satisfaction about new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) as well as the factors that had an influence on the attitudes towards NCMS. The sample, 4303 countryside residents aged ≥15-year, was randomly chosen by using stratified-cluster sampling method. Data were evaluated by using percentages, nonparametric tests and ordinal regression. As showed in this study, 73.2{\%} of the subjects were satisfied with NCMS. According to the results of single factor analysis, the attitudes towards NCMS were affected by gender, age, self-rated health status, whether having received health check-ups, and hospital stay during 2006, the difference proving to be statistically significant (P{\textless}0.05). In the ordinal regression analysis, it was found that the following factors, age, self-rated health status, whether having received health check-ups, and hospital stay during 2006, had an influence on satisfaction (P{\textless}0.05).},

abstract = {We forecast income growth over the period 2000-2050 in the US, Canada, and France. To ground the forecasts on relationships that are as robust as possible to changes in the environment, we use a quantitative theoretical approach which involves calibrating and simulating a general equilibrium model. Compared to existing studies, we allow for life uncertainty and migrations, use generational accounting studies to link taxes and public expenditures to demographic changes, and take into account the interaction between education and work experience. Forecasts show that growth will be weaker over the period 2010-2040. The gap between the US and the two other countries is increasing over time. France will catch-up and overtake Canada in 2020. Investigating alternative policy scenarios, we show that increasing the effective retirement age to 63 would be most profitable for France, reducing the gap between it and the US by one third. A decrease in social security benefits would slightly stimulate growth but would have no real impact on the gap between the countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unequal geographical distribution of medical care resources and insufficient healthcare coverage have been two long-standing problems with Taiwan's public health system. The implementation of National Health Insurance (NHI) attempted to mitigate the inequality in health care use. This study examines the degree to which Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) has reduced out-of-pocket medical expenditures in households in different regions and varying levels of income.

METHODS: Data used in this study were drawn from the 1994 and 1996 Surveys of Family Income and Expenditure. We pooled the data from 1994 and 1996 and included a year dummy variable (NHI), equal to 1 if the household data came from 1996 in order to assess the impact of NHI on household out-of-pocket medical care expenditures shortly after its implementation in 1995.

RESULTS: An individual who was older, female, married, unemployed, better educated, richer, head of a larger family household, or living in the central and eastern areas was more likely to have greater household out-of-pocket medical expenditures. NHI was found to have effectively reduced household out-of-pocket medical expenditures by 23.08{\%}, particularly for more affluent households. With the implementation of NHI, lower and middle income quintiles had smaller decreases in out-of-pocket medical expenditure. NHI was also found to have reduced household out-of-pocket medical expenditures more for households in eastern Taiwan.

CONCLUSION: Although NHI was established to create free medical care for all, further effort is needed to reduce the medical costs for certain disadvantaged groups, particularly the poor and aborigines, if equality is to be achieved.},

Agriculture in Africa south of the Sahara is at a prospective tipping point. Growth has accelerated in the past decade, but is unsustainable given increasing use of finite resources. The yield gap in African agriculture is significant, and scenarios on feeding the world's population into the future highlight the need for Africa to expand its agricultural production. Agricultural Research in Africa: Investing in Future Harvests discusses the need to shift to a growth path based on increased productivity—as in the rest of the developing world— which is essential if Africa is to increase rural incomes and compete in both domestic and international markets. Such a shift ultimately requires building on evolving improvements that collectively translate to deepening rural innovation capacity.},

abstract = {At the 1994 APEC meetings in Bogor, members made a commitment to form an APEC free trade area (FTA) by 2020. Using a multi-country, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper explores the impact of such an arrangement on Pacific Rim economies. An APEC FTA yields gains in GDP for all APEC countries, with larger gains for the developing countries which benefit more from the increased trade. There are advantages in making the FTA as broad as possible: omitting any one region (US, China, or ASEAN4) makes that region significantly worse off, and lowers the gains for all other members as well. The Asian NIEs have the most to gain from broad FTA membership-exclusion of China reduces Asian NIE gains by about half. Global trade liberalization including the EU and rest of world along with APEC is the most favorable outcome-with each APEC country gaining more from global liberalization than it does from joining an APEC FTA alone.},

With data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Healthy we test the theory that a “nothing to lose” attitude about the future predicts greater involvement in risky behaviors involving early sexual intercourse, selling drugs, and weapon use. We examine the effects of both individual- and school-level conditions. Results provide mixed support for our “nothing to lose” hypothesis. We do find noteworthy school-level effects of “school climate,” including aggregate expectations, mental health, and the prevalence of single-mother families, that influence adolescent risk-taking behavior more than school measures of SES. },

@article{Lin2016,
abstract = {Over the past decade, e-commerce has spread throughout China, providing an economic advancement opportunity for those in the lower classes of society. Villages who specialise in e-commerce, such as the Taobao villages, are booming. Taobao villages constitute an exciting phenomenon that has changed both the pattern of the rural economy, as well as the social foundation of rural daily life. This paper explores how everyday life in rural China has changed in response to the development of the network economy. Using Junpu village in Guangdong Province as a case study, our findings suggest that the development of e-commerce and network technology has changed the common values held towards rural life, the affection felt for the village, and the pace of life of local people. This development has also led to social separation in rural China. However, the intrusion of this new force of network economy has been resisted by local cultural structures such as family, clans, religion, and gender dynamics, leading to an unprecedented hybrid rurality. While network development has brought about the influence of modernity, the Chaoshan tradition of Junpu village has persisted and continued to be a part of life in this new stage of social life. The social milieu in rural China has been reconstructed and blends the alienation brought on by the operation of a network economy with the resistance felt from the practice of local cultural traditions.},

The three regions discussed here have a great majority of the poor on the planet. But supermarkets are no longer just niche players for rich consumers in the capital cities of the countries in these regions. The rapid rise of supermarkets in these regions in the past five to ten years has transformed agrifood markets at different rates and depths across regions and countries. Many of those transformations present great challenges—even exclusion—for small farms, and small processing and distribution firms, but also potentially great opportunities. Development models, policies, and programs need to adapt to this radical change.},

I find that the role of observable characteristics in explaining differences in the level of remittances, accounting for the self-selection in the decision to remit, is not large. The difference is explained by differences in the behavioral coefficients and by differences in the self-selection bias of those who remit out of the pool of emigrants between the two countries.},

Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant cost-effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.},

It then explores the links between these economic relationships, welfare burdens, and immigration policy. It concludes with an explanation for the apparent difference in immigration's impact in the two global eras, and thus on policy.},

The results suggest that the impact of the crisis was modest, leading to a 5{\%} reduction in average living standards and a 9{\%} increase in the incidence of poverty, with higher increases indicated for the depth and severity of poverty. The largest share of the overall impact on poverty appears attributable to the El Ni{\~{n}}o shock as opposed to shocks mediated through the labor market. Both household and community characteristics mattered to the differential impact of the crisis. There is some evidence of consumption smoothing by the crisis-affected households, though the poor amongst them were more constrained in their ability to protect their consumption.},

@article{Gollier1996,
abstract = {We examine in this paper a new natural restriction on utility functions, namely that adding an unfair background risk to wealth makes risk-averse individuals behave in a more risk-averse way with respect to any other independent risk. This concept is called risk vulnerability. It is equivalent to the condition that an undesirable risk can never be made desirable by the presence of an independent, unfair risk. Moreover, under risk vulnerability, adding an unfair background risk reduces the demand for risky assets. Risk vulnerability generalizes the concept of properness (individually undesirable, independent risks are always jointly undesirable) introduced by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987). It implies that the two first derivatives of the utility function are concave transformations of the original utility function. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, a sufficient condition for risk vulnerability is local properness, i.e. {\$}r" \backslashgeq r'r{\$}, where {\$}r{\$} is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion.},

Focusing on the 1998-2007 period for Poland, we use a unique dataset that contains information about household members who are currently living abroad, which allows us to develop region-specific emigration rates and to estimate the effect of emigration on wages using within-region variation. Our findings show that emigration led to a slight increase in wages for high- and medium-skilled workers, which are the two groups with the largest relative outmigration rates. Workers at the low end of the skill distribution might have experienced wage decreases.},

Conventional statistical and econometric techniques such as regression often work well, but there are issues unique to big datasets that may require different tools. First, the sheer size of the data involved may require more powerful data manipulation tools. Second, we may have more potential predictors than appropriate for estimation, so we need to do some kind of variable selection. Third, large datasets may allow for more flexible relationships than simple linear models. Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural nets, deep learning, and so on may allow for more effective ways to model complex relationships. In this essay, I will describe a few of these tools for manipulating and analyzing big data. I believe that these methods have a lot to offer and should be more widely known and used by economists.},

If one treats the farm household as the unit of analysis, it would be difficult to explain the conundrum. When seeing agricultural production from the lens of the division of labor, the puzzle can be easily solved. In response to rising labor costs, farmers outsource some power-intensive stages of production, such as harvesting, to specialized mechanization service providers, which are often clustered in a few counties and travel throughout the country to provide harvesting services at competitive prices. Through such an arrangement, smallholder farmers can stay viable in agricultural production.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many countries are developing health financing mechanisms to pursue the goal of universal coverage. In China, a rural health insurance system entitled New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is being developed since 2003. Although there is concern about whether the NCMS will influence the serious situation of inequity in health service utilization in rural China, there is only limited evidence available. This paper aims to assess the utilisation of outpatient and inpatient services among different income groups and provinces under NCMS in rural China.

METHODS: Using multistage sampling processes, a cross-sectional household survey including 6,147 rural households and 22,636 individuals, was conducted in six counties in Shandong and Ningxia Provinces, China. Chi-square test, Poisson regression and log-linear regression were applied to analyze the association between NCMS and the utilization of outpatient and inpatient services and the length of stay for inpatients. Qualitative methods including individual interview and focus group discussion were applied to explain and complement the findings from the household survey.

RESULTS: NCMS coverage was 95.9{\%} in Shandong and 88.0{\%} in Ningxia in 2006. NCMS membership had no significant association with outpatient service utilization regardless of income level and location.Inpatient service utilization has increased for the high income group under NCMS, but for the middle and low income, the change was not significant. Compared with non-members, NCMS members from Ningxia used inpatient services more frequently, while members from Shandong had a longer stay in hospital.High medical expenditure, low reimbursement rate and difference in NCMS policy design between regions were identified as the main reasons for the differences in health service utilization.

CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient service utilization has not significantly changed under NCMS. Although utilization of inpatient service in general has increased under NCMS, people with high income tend to benefit more than the low income group. While providing financial protection against catastrophic medical expenditure is the principal focus of NCMS, this study recommends that outpatient services should be incorporated in future NCMS policy development. NCMS policy should also be more equity oriented to achieve its policy goal.},

This paper discusses strategies for introducing gender analysis into these models and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the models from a gender perspective. It concludes that besides being blind to gender, the models are also blind to the waste of resources and impoverishment that stems from deficient aggregate demand, undemocratic decision making and directly unproductive expenditures that buttress male power. This waste is, however, likely to be diminished by moves to more egalitarian systems of gender relations, entailing changes in the structure of entitlements and the social matrix in which macroeconomic processes are embedded.},

abstract = {In rural Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America, the departure of migrants and the receipt of migrant remittances have led to declining rural populations and increasing cash incomes. It is commonly assumed that these processes will lead to agricultural abandonment and the regrowth of native vegetation, thus undermining traditional livelihoods and providing a boon for biodiversity conservation. However, an increasing number of household-level studies have found mixed and complex effects of out-migration and remittances on agriculture. We advance this literature by using household survey data and satellite imagery from three study areas in rural Ecuador to investigate the effects of migration and remittances on agricultural land use. Multivariate methods are used to disaggregate the effects of migration and remittances, to account for other influences on land use and to correct for the potential endogeneity of migration and remittances. Contrary to common assumptions but consistent with previous studies, we find that migrant departure has a positive effect on agricultural activities that is offset by migrant remittances. These results suggest that rural out-migration alone is not likely to lead to a forest transition in the study areas. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) aims to provide health insurance to 800 million rural citizens and correct distortions in rural Chinese health care. However, many questions about its impact on individuals and rural health care providers remain unanswered. The overall goal of this dissertation is to study the implementation of NCMS and its impact on all of the actors in China's rural health sector. To achieve my overall goal, I have four specific objectives, each pursued in the essays herein. The first objective is to determine the extent to which NCMS has been implemented in China's village households, and to examine the some of its strengths and weaknesses. The second is to measure the impact of NCMS and it's policy attributes on the most frequently visited primary health care providers in China: village clinics. My third objective is to examine the unique role of village clinics providing care and welfare benefits to the elderly, benefits that may be at risk under NCMS. Fourth, I measure the impact of NCMS and policy attributes on Township Health Centers (THCs), the main NCMS partner health facilities. Finally, in an appendix chapter, I place the recent health care reforms into a broader context of shifting public policy in China, and speculate on the potential implications of this policy shift. To achieve my objectives, I use a nationally representative set of panel data collected in 100 villages drawn from 5 provinces in China. Detailed modules for each of the major actors - including individuals and their specific illness episodes, the clinics and hospitals they visit, and the county-level public health offices that cover them - allow me to paint a nuanced picture of China's rural health system in transition. I find that NCMS has reduced out of pocket medical spending and yielded meaningful reductions in household risk. However, current versions are not adequately meeting participants' need (and desire) for catastrophic illness coverage. Evidence suggests that better reimbursement rates may increase the important benefits the program has had for THC finances. The program must also be better calibrated to support village clinics through efficient outpatient reimbursement and subsidies to offset additional work requirements. This is particularly important given the unique welfare role played by clinicians in village communities.},

Socioeconomic impacts are much larger during major drought years, thus underscoring the importance of extreme weather events in determining climate damages. Climate change scenarios draw on projections for 2025. Results indicate that, in the worst case scenario, damages caused by climate change are half the size of those from current variability.

abstract = {Although a sizable fraction of the Puerto Rican–born population moved to the United States, the island also received large inflows of persons born outside Puerto Rico. Hence Puerto Rico provides a unique setting for examining how labor inflows and outflows coexist and measuring the mirror-image wage impact of these flows. The study yields two findings. First, the skills of the out-migrants differ from those of the in-migrants. Puerto Rico attracts high-skill in-migrants and exports low-skill workers. Second, the two flows have opposing effects on wages: in-migrants lower the wage of competing workers, and out-migrants in- crease the wage.},

With EU enlargement in 2004, 1.2. million workers from Eastern Europe emigrated to the UK and Ireland. I use this emigration wave to show that emigration significantly changed the wage distribution in the sending country, in particular between young and old workers. Using a novel dataset from Lithuania, the UK and Ireland for the calibration of a structural model of labor demand, I find that over the period of five years emigration increased the wages of young workers by 6{\%}, while it had no effect on the wages of old workers. Contrary to the immigration literature, there is no significant effect of emigration on the wage distribution between high-skilled and low-skilled workers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In social and economic networks linked agents often share additional links in common. There are two competing explanations for this phenomenon. First, agents may have a structural taste for transitive links -- the returns to linking may be higher if two agents share links in common. Second, agents may assortatively match on unobserved attributes, a process called homophily. I study parameter identifiability in a simple model of dynamic network formation with both effects. Agents form, maintain, and sever links over time in order to maximize utility. The return to linking may be higher if agents share friends in common. A pair-specific utility component allows for arbitrary homophily on time-invariant agent attributes. I derive conditions under which it is possible to detect the presence of a taste for transitivity in the presence of assortative matching on unobservables. I leave the joint distribution of the initial network and the pair-specific utility component, a very high dimensional object, unrestricted. The analysis is of the `fixed effects' type. The identification result is constructive, suggesting an analog estimator, whose single large network properties I characterize.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of participation in the Public Works component of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program, the largest social protection program in Sub-Saharan Africa outside of South Africa, on schooling and child labor. Income from Public Works should reduce demand for child labor and increase schooling. However, Public Works labor requirements may induce a substitution of child labor for adult labor at home and in income-generating activities, possibly reducing schooling. Using matching estimators to identify program impacts, we find evidence of both processes at work. Results are presented by gender and by age cohorts because returns to schooling may differ by gender and the opportunity cost of schooling varies by gender and age of the child. We find that participation in Public Works leads to a moderate reduction in agricultural labor hours on average for boys age 6-16 years and a reduction in domestic labor hours for younger boys age 6-10 years. Boys in households receiving more regular transfers (at least 90 birr per member) show large increases in school attendance rates and, at the younger age, a significant reduction in total hours worked. When Public Works is coupled with agricultural packages designed to boost farm productivity, there are no affects on boys schooling and labor hours fall only for younger boys in domestic chores. For girls, measured effects are weaker, but differences emerge between younger (age 6-10) and older (age 11-16) girls. Younger girls experience worse outcomes, with lower school attendance on average and increases in child labor in households participating in PW and the OFSP. Older girls benefit, with a reduction in labor hours on average and an increase in school attendance in households receiving larger transfers.},

Online surveys with college students (n = 298) were conducted. E-shopping quality for apparel products consists of four dimensions: web site design, customer service, privacy/security, and atmospheric/experiential. A structural equation model reveals that e-shopping quality determines perceptions of usefulness, trust, and enjoyment, which in turn influence consumers' attitudes toward e-shopping. Consumer perceptions of usefulness and attitude toward e-shopping influence intention to shop online, while perceived ease of use does not influence attitude toward e-shopping. Shopping enjoyment and trust play significant roles in consumers' adoption of e-shopping. This study provides important implications for e-tailers whose web site developers must keep in mind that customers are not only web users with trust/safety and information needs, but also shoppers with service and experiential needs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Microglia are brain cells of considerable interest because of their role in CNS inflammatory responses and strong association with neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, immunocytochemistry was combined with unbiased stereology to estimate the mean total number of microglia in dentate gyrus and CA1 regions of the mouse hippocampus. Systematic-uniform-random (SUR) sections were cut through the hippocampal formation of male C57BL/6J mice (n = 7, 4-5 months) and immunostained with Mac-1, an antibody to the complement subunit 3 receptor (CR3). The total number of Mac-1 immunopositive cells was determined using the optical fractionator method. The mean total number of microglia in the mouse dentate gyrus was estimated to be 20300 (CV = 0.21) with a mean coefficient of error (CE)= 0.09. The mean total number of microglia in the mouse CA1 was estimated to be 43200 (CV = 0.24) with a CE = 0.11. Comparison of total number estimates, derived from fraction- or volume-based methods, supported stereological theory regarding the equivalence of the two techniques. The time required to determine total microglia number in both hippocampal sub-regions was approximate to 6 h per mouse from stained sections. The combination of immunocytochemistry and stereology provides a reliable means to assess microglia number that can easily be adopted for studies of transgenic and lesion-based models of aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

@article{Mongin1998,
abstract = {Slightly longer version t h a n the published one. Expected Utility Theory (EUT) states that the decision maker (DM) chooses between risky or uncertain prospects by comparing their expected utility values, i.e., the weighted sums obtained by adding the utility values of outcomes multiplied by their respective probabilities. This elementary and seemingly commonsensical decision rule raises at once the most important questions in contemporary decision theory. First, what do the utility numbers in the formula refer to, and in particular do they belong to the same value scale as do the utility numbers that represent the DM's choices under certainty? Second, is the weighted sum procedure of combining probability and utility values the only one to be considered, and if there are indeed alternative, intuitively attractive modellings, how will the theorist arbitrate this conflict? Third, should it be taken for granted that the DM relies on probability values, or are there again alternative constructions that call for theoretical comparison? The last question is normally addressed only in the context of uncertainty, as opposed to risk, that is, in a context in which probabilities are not explicitly part of the agent's decision problem. Corresponding to this standard distinction, there are two well-received versions of the theory, i.e., Subjective Expected Utility Theory (SEUT) in the case of uncertainty, and von Neumann-Morgenstern Theory (VNMT) in the case of risk. We shall examine each question in turn, after restating the sources and basic axiomatic structure of EUT. It has been used as both a positive and normative or prescriptive theory, which suggests a rich potential of philosophical discussion. Methodological discussions are primarily concerned with the theory in its first role, and the second question, which in effect relates to the relaxation of the " VNM independence axiom " . The history of EUT is often construed in terms of the following smooth generalization process: the principle of maximizing expected monetary values antidates EUT, which is now in the process of being generalized in two directions, by either non-additive or non-probabilistic decision theories. The highlights in this sequence are Bernoulli's (1738) resolution of the St. Petersburg paradox, and Allais's (1953) invention of a thought-provoking problem widely referrred to as the Allais paradox. In the St. Petersburg game people were asked how much they would pay for the following prospect: if tails comes out of the first toss of a fair coin, to receive nothing and stop the game, and in the complementary case, to receive two guilders and stay in the game; if tails comes out of the second toss of the coin, to receive nothing and stop the game, and in the complementary case, to receive four guilders and stay in the game; and so on ad infinitum. The expected monetary value of this 2 prospect is ∑ n (2 n ×1/2 n) = infinite. Since the people always set a definite, possibly quite small upper value on the St. Petersburg prospect, it follows that they do not price it in terms of its expected monetary value. Bernoulli argued in effect that they estimate it in terms of the utility of money outcomes, and defended the Log function as a plausible idealisation, given its property of quickly decreasing marginal utilities. Because the resulting series, ∑ n (Log 2 n ×1/2 n), is convergent, Bernoulli's hypothesis is supposed to deliver a solution to the paradox; more on the debate surrounding the latter can be found in Todhunter (1865). At least, Bernoulli's hypothesis counts as the first systematic occurrence of EUT theory. Two centuries later, Allais questioned the naturalness of EU-based choices by devising the following questionnaire. Question 1: which prospect would you choose of x 1 = to receive 100 millions FF with probability 1, and y 1 = to receive 500 millions FF with probabibility 0.10, 100 millions FF with probability 0.89, and nothing with probability 0.01. Question 2: which prospect would you choose of x 2 = to receive 100 millions FF with probability 0.11, and nothing with probability 0.89, and y 2 =to receive 500 millions FF with probability 0.10, and nothing with probability 0.90. Allais found that the majority answers were x 1 to question 1 and y 2 to question 2, and argued that this pair of prospects could indeed be chosen for good reasons. But it violates EUT, since there is no function U that would both satisfy: U(100) {\textgreater} 10/100 U(500) + 89/100 U(100) + 1/100 U(0), and 11/100 U(100) + 89/100 U(0) {\textless} 10/100 U(500) + 90/100 U(0). Although the word " paradox " is frequently used in the history of EUT, it should be clear from these two famous examples that it does not refer to deeply ingrained conceptual difficulties, such as Russell's paradox in set theory, or the EPR paradox in physics, but rather just to problems or anomalies for the theory that is currently taken for granted --expected monetary value theory and EUT, respectively. There are few explicit EU calculations in economics before von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), who chose to determine the utility value of a randomized strategy in this mathematically convenient way. Their theoretical choice has proved to be of long-lasting influence. Not only is current game theory (including its branch specialized in incomplete information games, which dates back to Harsanyi's work in the late sixties) still heavily dependent on EU calculations, but the same can be said, although to a lesser degree, of today's microeconomics of imperfect information, as textbooks will confirm. Like Bernoulli, VNM are concerned with the case in which the probabilities are part of the decision problem. Their work did not yet amount to an axiomatization in the sense decision theorists and economists have become accustomed to. It is only in the hands of Marschak and of Herstein and Milnor, in the early fifties, that the EU formula was derived as the numerical counterpart of a qualitatively defined preference structure subjected to various axiomatic constraints. In homage to the founders of game theory, this derivation is called the VNM theorem. Their historical precedence should not lead methodologists to overlook a curious historical fact: the axiom which was to arouse innumerable discussions after Allais, i.e., the independence axiom, also called V N M},

The estimated elasticity of Philippine-peso remittances with respect to the exchange rate is 0.60. Positive migrant shocks lead to enhanced human capital accumulation and entrepreneurship in origin households. Child schooling and educational expenditure rise, while child labour falls.

In addition, we look at the economywide impact in the long run when all markets have settled at a new equilibrium. We find that in the short run, poverty has increased substantially. However, in the longer run, we find welfare levels of rural farm households in particular to rise sharply, primarily as a result of increased returns to farm labor and agricultural land coupled with improved market prices for output sold. These results call for policies that aim to protect the most vulnerable against high food prices and extreme volatility in the short run, without eliminating the incentives of steadily rising commodity prices for longer-run structural agricultural development.

abstract = {In this paper we study the interrelationship between determinants of migration, conceived as a family strategy, and the potential impact of having a migrant household member on the people left behind. Labour migration is often related to poverty but, given its lumpy-investment nature, lack of resources may constitute both a motivation and a hurdle to migrate. We use a cross-sectional household survey from rural Bangladesh to test whether migration is a diversification strategy that enables sending households to uptake high-yielding seed technology. We account for heterogeneity of migration constraints by differentiating between temporary-domestic, permanent-domestic and international movement. We find that households able to engage in costly high-return migration (i.e. international migration) are more likely to employ modern farming technology, thereby achieving higher productivity. Poorer households, on the other hand, are unable to overcome the entry costs of cross-border movement and fall back on low net-return (i.e. domestic) migration, which does not drive production enhancements and may act as a poverty-trap. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biomass combustion with traditional cookstoves causes substantial environmental and health harm. Nontraditional cookstove technologies can be efficacious in reducing this adverse impact, but they are adopted and used at puzzlingly low rates. This study analyzes the determinants of low demand for nontraditional cookstoves in rural Bangladesh by using both stated preference (from a nationally representative survey of rural women) and revealed preference (assessed by conducting a cluster-randomized trial of cookstove prices) approaches. We find consistent evidence across both analyses suggesting that the women in rural Bangladesh do not perceive indoor air pollution as a significant health hazard, prioritize other basic developmental needs over nontraditional cookstoves, and overwhelmingly rely on a free traditional cookstove technology and are therefore not willing to pay much for a new nontraditional cookstove. Efforts to improve health and abate environmental harm by promoting nontraditional cookstoves may be more successful by designing and disseminating nontraditional cookstoves with features valued more highly by users, such as reduction of operating costs, even when those features are not directly related to the cookstoves' health and environmental impacts.},

abstract = {A growing literature documents cyclical movements in mortality and health. We examine this pattern more closely and attempt to identify the mechanisms behind it. Specifically, we distinguish between mechanisms that rely on fluctuations in own employment or time use and those involving factors that are external to the individual. Our investigation suggests that changes in individuals own behavior contribute very little to pro-cyclical mortality. Looking across broad age and gender groups, we find that own-group employment rates are not systematically related to own-group mortality. In addition, we find that most of the additional deaths that occur during times of economic growth are among the elderly, particularly elderly women, who have limited labor force attachment. Focusing on mortality among the elderly, we show that cyclicality is especially strong for deaths occurring in nursing homes, and is stronger in states where a higher fraction of the elderly reside in nursing homes. We also demonstrate that staffing in skilled nursing facilities moves counter-cyclically. Taken together, these findings suggest that cyclical fluctuations in the mortality rate may be largely driven by fluctuations in the quality of health care.},

abstract = {This paper argues that feminist analysis is finally making an impact in the field of economics. It begins with an historical overview of the alternative theoretical approaches that have discussed women's issues, particularly since the 1950s and 1960s, and it argues that, during the 1980s and 1990s, these approaches have tended to converge, at least partially, through the use of gender as a central category of analysis. The influence of postmodernism and the development of feminist theory have laid the basis for the task of transforming economics and engendering theory and policy. At the same time, feminist analysis has shifted from its main concentration on microeconomics to the discussion of macroeconomics. More specifically, the paper discusses two areas in which progress toward engendering economic analysis has been made since the late 1970s: 1. (a) the visibility of women's work and its inclusion in labor force and national accounting statistics, and 2. (b) macroeconomic issues, with focus on the area of gender and development and of structural adjustment policies, with particular reference to alternative models to the orthodox structural adjustment packages.},

Linking national and multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) models: the effects of an increase in award wage rates in Australia, Regional Studies. Wages for 20{\%} of Australian workers are set by awards, reviewed annually in a centralized legal process. For the 2005 review, the economy-wide and regional effects of increases in awards were modelled. A top-down approach in which results from a national model, MONASH, are fed into a multi-regional model, MMRF, was adopted. This enabled the authors to produce regional results while taking advantage of detailed labour-market specifications that were available only in MONASH. In using MMRF, a limitation of previous top-down methods was overcome ? the inability to handle shocks affecting cost relativities between regions. Dixon P. B., Madden J. R. et Rimmer M. T.

abstract = {In 2015, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees accommodated over 15 million refugees, mostly in refugee camps in developing countries. The World Food Program provided these refugees with food aid, in cash or in kind. Refugees' impacts on host countries are controversial and little understood. This unique study analyzes the economic impacts of refugees on host-country economies within a 10-km radius of three Congolese refugee camps in Rwanda. Simulations using Monte Carlo methods reveal that cash aid to refugees creates significant positive income spillovers to host-country businesses and households. An additional adult refugee receiving cash aid increases annual real income in the local economy by {\$}205 to {\$}253, significantly more than the {\$}120-{\$}126 in aid each refugee receives. Trade between the local economy and the rest of Rwanda increases by {\$}49 to {\$}55. The impacts are lower for in-kind food aid, a finding relevant to development aid generally.},

abstract = {This article reviews and critically assesses evidence on input subsidy programs implemented in selected countries over the past decade in Africa. We believe that input subsidies should be considered wicked problems because of the indeterminacy and difficulty surrounding how they are evaluated. Main findings from the current body of literature are that input subsidies provide some measurable but relatively small positive benefit to recipient households' well-being. In addition, most studies find that subsidized inputs crowd out commercial input purchases, mitigating the extent to which subsidy programs contribute to total fertilizer use and crop production. African governments may wish to carefully consider the benefits and distributional effects of input subsidy programs relative to other uses of scarce public resources.},

The microeconomic models serve to investigate incentives to develop and adopt environmentally friendlier technologies under different policy tools, commitment strategies and market structures. Here price-based instruments usually outperform command and control policies. In most growth models a trade-off between growth rates and environmental quality occurs. Moreover, typically three market imperfections arise, market power for new products, R{\&}D spillovers and pollution. These imperfections can be mitigated by subsidies on output and R{\&}D effort, and taxes on emissions.},

@article{Silori2001b,
abstract = {Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in southern India plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, especially of large mammals, by offering habitat contiguity of about 3300 km(2) with three other protected areas in the region, namely Nagarahole and Bandipur National Parks and Wynaad Wildlife Sanctuary through forest corridors between the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats forests. The habitat linkage is crucial for large ranging animals such as elephants, which use these forest corridors for migration. Livestock grazing, a major biotic interference in forest corridors, originates from seven settlements of the Masinagudi group of villages on the eastern and the southeastern fringes of the sanctuary. Construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations, numbering about three at Singara, Marvakandy (Masinagudi) and Moyar, around the Masinagudi villages caused a rapid growth in human population (143{\%} between 1961 and 1991), particularly the landless labourers and livestock. Free grazing by about 15 000-17 000 resident as well as migratory livestock every year in and around the forest corridors, coupled with removal of cattle dung from the forest floor, have adversely affected the forest regeneration and helped proliferation of weed species such as Lantana camara, Casia tora, C. occidentalis, Opuntia dillenii, and Ageratum conyzoides. The annual fodder production from the corridor forest could meet the demand of about two-thirds of the resident population, while the crop residues from the marginal agriculture could not support the remaining one-third livestock population. In view of such a situation, measures have been suggested to reduce livestock population and implement the ecodevelopment packages in order to ensure the corridor connectivity for the long-term conservation of the elephant population.},

I present a model that decomposes epidemic level into differences in sexual behavior and differences in viral transmission rates. I argue, using evidence drawn from the existing medical literature, that Africa has very high HIV transmission rates, likely due to high rates of other untreated sexually transmitted infections, while transmission rates in the United States are low. The difference in transmission rates is large enough to explain the observed difference in prevalence between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa. The model also provides a good fit to cross-country data within Africa and suggests that, in contrast to the intracontinental results, differences within that continent can be attributed to differences in sexual behavior and epidemic timing. The results suggest that cost-effective policy interventions would focus on decreasing transmission rates within Africa, possibly by treating other untreated sexually transmitted infections.

abstract = {To function effectively, individuals must voluntarily postpone immediate gratification and persist in goal-directed behavior for the sake of later outcomes. The present research program analyzed the nature of this type of future-oriented self-control and the psychological processes that underlie it. Enduring individual differences in self-control were found as early as the preschool years. Those 4-year-old children who delayed gratification longer in certain laboratory situations developed into more cognitively and socially competent adolescents, achieving higher scholastic performance and coping better with frustration and stress. Experiments in the same research program also identified specific cognitive and attentional processes that allow effective self-regulation early in the course of development. The experimental results, in turn, specified the particular types of preschool delay situations diagnostic for predicting aspects of cognitive and social competence later in life.},

abstract = {Background: Aims of the present study were to examine the anthropometrical and metabolic characteristics of the Filipino population migrant to the Southern European city of Rome, Italy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the city of Rome. Three hundred thirty-five Filipinos (95 M/240 F, mean age: 44.0 +/- 9.8 years, mean residence in Italy: 12.9 +/- 6.3 years) were studied. Data were collected by standardized questionnaires; anthropometrical parameters, arterial pressure, and fasting capillary blood glucose (FCG) were measured. Results: Abdominal obesity was found in 52.5{\%}, and BMI {\textgreater}25 kg/m2 in 44.5{\%} of subjects. History of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension were reported by 6.0 and 9.0{\%} of subjects, respectively. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 13.1{\%}, and FCG {\textgreater}110 mg/dl in 18.5{\%} of subjects. Altered systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure was found in 34.3{\%} of subjects. About three-fourths of subjects were unaware of being diabetic and/or hypertensive. Years of Italy residence showed a direct significant correlation with the degree of changes in alimentary behaviours (p = 0.18, p = 0.001), and with weight gain (p = 0.27, p {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed only age and waist circumference to be associated with both diabetes and hypertension. Conclusions: In the present study, the first to examine the metabolic disorders in a migrant Filipino population resident in Rome, a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension was found. The alarming results emerging from this study should be seriously considered by public health practitioners and decision makers, and made known to the Filipinos resident in Europe.

But what are the net trends? The neoliberal argument says that world poverty and income inequality fell over the past two decades for the first time in more than a century and a half, thanks to the rising density of economic integration across national borders. The evidence therefore confirms that globalization in the context of the world economic regime in place since the end of Bretton Woods generates more “mutual benefit” than “conflicting interests.” This paper questions the empirical basis of the neoliberal argument.},

@article{Heltberg2002b,
abstract = {This paper identifies key causal factors behind farmers' marketing decisions in Mozambique. A two-step decision making process is outlined. Farmers decide, first, whether or not to participate in the market. Next, they decide how much to sell. The model is estimated using a Heckman switching regression approach. The key importance of non-price factors such as risk, technology and transport infrastructure come out clearly. Marginal effects are calculated for poor and nonpoor households and broken down into a market participation and a quantity (sales value) component. The marginal effects for the poor are not substantially different from those of the nonpoor. This suggests that differences in area-based characteristics (especially risk and technology) are more influential in the commercialization process than differences in how the poor and the nonpoor respond to incentives. Moreover, interventions to promote market access are likely to solicit a greater volume of additional supply from peasants entering the market for the first time than from existing market participants stepping up their production and sales. To achieve pro-poor rural growth it is essential to address explicitly the conditions of high-risk, low productivity and low capital endowments of poor farmers.},

They find that children in migrant households have lower rates of infant mortality and higher birth-weights. The authors study the channels through which migration may affect health outcomes and find evidence that migration raises health knowledge in addition to the direct effect on wealth. However they also find that preventative health care, such as breastfeeding and vaccinations, is less likely for children in migrant households. These results provide a broader and more nuanced view of the health consequences of migration than is offered by the existing literature.},

@article{HUANG2007,
abstract = {The overall goal of this paper is to examine the impacts of trade liberalization on China's agriculture, in general, and poverty, in particular. The impacts on agriculture are analyzed by commodity and by region. Because different farmers (especially those in different income brackets) produce diverse sets of commodities, the main part of our paper analyzes the effects on households and their implications for the poverty through the simulation of household production and consumption changes in response to the trade-induced market prices changes on a disaggregated (by province), household-level basis. The results of our analysis lead to the conclusion that, unlike fears expressed in the popular press and by some scholars, the positive impacts of trade liberalization are actually greater than the negative ones. Although other effects on the rural economy from trade liberalization of other subsectors (such as textiles) may be equally large or even larger, this study's focus on the agricultural sector shows that there will be an impact from agricultural trade liberalization and that the net impact is positive for the average farm household in China. However, policymakers still need to be concerned. Not all households and not all commodities will be treated equally. Our findings show that poorer households, especially those in the provinces in the western parts of China, will be hurt. The main reason is that the farmers in Western China are currently producing commodities that are receiving positive rates of protection, rates of protection that will fall with additional trade liberalization. Hence, if policy makers want to minimize the impacts, there needs to be an effort to minimize the effect on these households either by direct assistance or by eliminating constraints that are keeping households from becoming more efficient by shifting their production more towards those commodities that will benefit from trade liberalization. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Effective visualisations of migration flows can substantially enhance our understanding of underlying patterns and trends. However, commonly used migration maps that show place-to-place flows as stroked lines drawn atop a geographic map fall short of conveying the complexities of human movement in a clear and compelling manner. We introduce circular migration plots, a new method for visualising and exploring migration flow tables in an intuitively graspable way. Our approach aims to provide detailed quantitative information on the intensities and patterns of migration flows around the globe by using a visualization design that is effective and visually appealing. The key elements of the design are (a) the arrangement of origins and destinations of migration flows in a circular layout, (b) the scaling of individual flows to allow the entire system to be shown simultaneously, (c) the expression of the volume of movement through the width of the flow and its direction through the colour of the origin. Drawing on new estimates of 5-year bilateral migration flows between 196 countries, we demonstrate how to create circular migration plots at regional and country levels using three alternative software packages: Circos, R, and the JavaScript library d3.js. Circular migration plots considerably improve our ability to graphically evaluate complex patterns and trends in migration flow data, and for communicating migration research to scientists in other disciplines and to the general public. Our visualisation method is applicable to other kinds of flow data, including trade and remittances flows.},

Given the questionable nature of some of the assumptions sufficient for separability, I apply a recent methodology that accounts for the simultaneity between the production and consumption decisions of a farm household. Using data from rural India, direct estimates of the marginal productivities (shadow wages) of family male and female labor are derived from a Cobb-Douglas agricultural production function. The estimated shadow wages and income are then used as regressors in a structural model of labor supply.},

abstract = {The high and rising household savings rate in China is not easily reconciled with the traditional explanations that emphasize life cycle factors, the precautionary saving motive, financial development, or habit formation. This paper proposes a new competitive saving motive: as the sex ratio rises, Chinese parents with a son raise their savings in a competitive manner in order to improve their son's relative attractiveness for marriage. The pressure on savings spills over to other households. Both cross-regional and household-level evidence supports this hypothesis. This factor can potentially account for about half the actual increase in the household savings rate during 1990--2007.},

We employ comparative productivity of agricultural labor as an index of labor market distortion to see the impact of difference of labor market maturity among regions on regional growth performance, controlling for a set of variables determining growth rate. The finding is that (1) there is an evidence of conditional convergence in China's growth, namely, per capita GDP in the initiative year is negatively related to growth rates in following years, (2) labor market distortion negatively impacts regional growth rates, and (3) many other variables used at previous studies impact growth performance, as is expected by neoclassical theory of growth.},

abstract = {The paper reviews recent theory and empirical evidence testing unitary versus collective models of the household. In contrast to the unitary model, the collective model posits that individuals within households have different preferences and do not pool their income. Moreover, the collective model predicts that intrahousehold allocations reflect differences in preferences and "bargaining power" of individuals within the household. Using new household data sets from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and South Africa, we present measures of individual characteristics that are highly correlated with bargaining power, namely human capital and individually-controlled assets, evaluated at the time of marriage. In all country case studies we reject the unitary model as a description of household behavior, but to different degrees. Results suggest that assets controlled by women have a positive and significant effect on expenditure allocations toward the next generation, such as education and children's clothing. We also examine individual-level education outcomes and find that parents do not have identical preferences toward sons and daughters within or across countries.},

abstract = {This chapter summarizes recent research in economics that investigates differentials by race and gender in the labor market. We start with a statistical overview of the trends in labor market outcomes by race, gender and Hispanic origin, including some simple regressions on the determinants of wages and employment. This is followed in Section 3 by an extended review of current theories about discrimination in the labor market, including recent extensions of taste-based theories, theories of occupational exclusion, and theories of statistical discrimination. Section 4 discusses empirical research that provides direct evidence of discrimination in the labor market, beyond "unexplained gaps" in wage or employment regressions. The remainder of the chapter reviews the evidence on race and gender gaps, particularly wage gaps. Section 5 reviews research on the impact of pre-market human capital differences in education and family background that differ by race and gender. Section 6 reviews the impact of differences in both the levels and the returns to experience and seniority, with discussion of the role of training and labor market search and turnover on race and gender differentials. Section 7 reviews the role of job characteristics (particularly occupational characteristics) in the gender wage gap. Section 8 reviews the smaller literature on differences in fringe benefits by gender. Section 9 is an extensive discussion of the empirical work that accounts for changes in the trends in race and gender differentials over time. Of particular interest is the new research literature that investigates the impact of widening wage inequality on race and gender wage gaps. Section 10 reviews research that relates policy changes to race and gender differentials, including anti-discrimination policy. The chapter concludes with comments about a future research agenda.},

abstract = {Over the past half a century developing regions, with the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa, have seen labor-saving technologies adopted at unprecedented levels. Intensification of production systems created power bottlenecks around the land preparation, harvesting and threshing operations. Alleviating the power bottlenecks with the adoption of mechanical technologies helped enhance agricultural productivity and lowered the unit cost of crop production even in the densely populated countries of Asia. Economic growth and the commercialization of agricultural systems is leading to further mechanization of agricultural systems in Asia and Latin America. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have very low levels of mechanization and available data indicate declining rather than increasing levels of adoption, even among the countries that were the early trendsetters, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe. This chapter documents the trends and sequential patterns in the adoption of mechanical technology, assesses the evidence on the productivity and equity impact of mechanization, and discusses the implication for mechanization policy. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Research on growing American political polarization and antipathy primarily studies public institutions and political processes, ignoring private effects, including strained family ties. Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by residents from opposing-party precincts were 30 to 50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Reductions in the duration of Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy political advertising—an effect not observed in 2015—implying a relationship to election-related behavior. Effects appear asymmetric: Although fewer Democratic-precinct residents traveled in 2016 than in 2015, Republican-precinct residents shortened their Thanksgiving dinners by more minutes in response to political differences. Nationwide, 34 million hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving dinner discourse were lost in 2016 owing to partisan effects. A merican political partisanship has risen sharply over the past 25 years. More than 55{\%} of Democrats and Republicans de-scribed " very unfavorable " feelings toward the opposing party in 2016, up from 17 to 21{\%} in the mid-1990s; growing numbers of In-dependents express disfavor with both parties, and rising party defections increase polarization (1). Spatial partisan sorting produces increas-ingly homogeneous electoral " bubbles " at both state and local levels (2), and political minorities within these bubbles show reticence to partici-pate in or reveal their party affiliation (3). Animosity toward political rivals is not lim-ited to the ballot box; implicit partisan biases manifest in discriminatory decisions even more frequently than racial or gender biases (4). Par-ents express intolerance of their children dating and marrying across partisan lines (5), and ob-served dating and marital choices segregate more strongly on politics than on physical attributes or personality characteristics (6). Political polar-ization affects decisions, such as where to work and shop, at higher rates than race, ethnicity, or religion (7). We study whether politics strain close family ties by measuring family-gathering durations. After the historically divisive 2016 presidential election, 39{\%} of American families avoided po-litical conversations during the holidays, an aver-sion that spanned both party and socioeconomic lines (8). We examine Thanksgiving, which, in U.S. election years, may bring together family members with differing political views just weeks after votes are cast. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in the wake of the 2016 election, many fam-ilies canceled or otherwise cut short Thanksgiv-ing plans with their most politically problematic relatives (9). Several cognitive biases in social and political psychology explain why individuals might limit such interactions. A " partisan selective exposure " motivation occurs when individuals avoid counter-attitudinal political information that might engen-der cognitive dissonance or harm relationships (10). Numerous studies find " belief polarization, " whereby individuals gravitate toward more ex-treme versions of their own initial positions during discussion of political issues (11). Exac-erbating this effect, individuals also incorrectly expect others to respond to discussion and de-bate in the same direction as their own response, anticipating belief convergence rather than polar-ization (12), and attribute a lack of convergence to the bias and irrationality of others, while viewing themselves and copartisans as less ideological than cross-partisans (13). Our study examines whether these effects, which are well-studied in experimental settings among strangers, extend to close family gatherings. We analyze how political differences affect the duration of Thanksgiving dinner by merging two datasets. Anonymized smartphone-location data from more than 10 million Americans allow observation of actual travel at extremely precise spatial and temporal levels. We combine this with a precinct-level database for the 2016 elec-tion to impute presidential voting at the finest spatial resolution possible. By comparing vote shares in an individual's home and Thanks-giving destination precincts, we test the relation-ship between political disagreement and time expenditure.

abstract = {This paper links urbanization strategies to changes in land use and associated impacts on rural communities and agro-ecosystems in a rural area of China. Energy, monetary and human time variables as well as information on environmental pressures, have been combined to compare different typologies of households and the metabolism of different patterns of land use from an integrated perspective. The results show that urbanization strategies, aimed at shifting the current land use and at displacing the local population, while increasing the economic efficiency is also associated with an increase in fossil energy consumption and environmental pressure, as well as a reduction of the multifunctional characteristic of the area under investigation. Based on these findings the paper also offers a critical discussion of the Chinese rural development policy arguing that the multifunctionality of rural areas should be taken into account by Chinese policy-makers and planners as a viable strategy to achieve rural development targets.},

Consumption grew substantially, but with diverse experiences across villages and individuals. Rainfall shocks have a substantial impact on consumption growth, which persists for many years. There also is a persistent growth impact from the large-scale famine in the 1980s, as well as substantial externalities from road infrastructure. The persistent effects of rainfall shocks and the famine crisis imply that welfare losses due to the lack of insurance and protection measures are well beyond the welfare cost of short-term consumption fluctuations.},

The former Soviet Union's net agricultural imports increase, whereas Eastern Europe's net agricultural trade balances improve. Overall, agricultural exporters will benefit, particularly, if productivity increases are not limited to or disproportionally high in agriculture.},

abstract = {Growth is pro-poor if the poverty measure of interest falls. According to this definition there are three potential sources of pro-poor growth: (a) a high growth rate of average incomes; (b) a high sensitivity of poverty to growth in average incomes; and (c) a poverty-reducing pattern of growth in relative incomes. I empirically decompose changes in poverty in a sample of developing countries during the 1980s and 1990s into these three components. In the medium- to long-run, most of the variation in changes in poverty can be attributed to growth in average incomes, suggesting that policies and institutions that promote broad-based growth should be central to the pro-poor growth agenda. Most of the remainder of the variation in changes in poverty is due to poverty-reducing patterns of growth in relative incomes, rather than differences in the sensitivity of poverty to growth in average incomes. Cross-country evidence provides relatively little guidance as to the policies and institutions that promote these other sources of pro-poor growth.},

Moreover, it is shown that, if Japan is to benefit from admitting foreign labor, the scale of admission should be large and the admission should be accompanied by trade liberalization.},

Just as retailers seek to develop online retail websites as profitable channels of distribution, researchers have pursued answers to this very question. In pursuing this line of research, several approaches have been utilized including those based upon behavioral economics, lifestyle analysis, and merchandising effects. While some of this work identifies the potential moderation of personality traits most of it focuses on factors related to time, costs and benefits, and shopping context. Following the hierarchical approach to personality developed by Mowen (Mowen J. The 3M Model of Motivation and Personality. Norwell, MA: Kluwer Academic Press, 2000.), this study seeks to understand online purchase intent using personality constructs. The present study uses data from an online consumer panel to develop a hierarchical model of personality useful for predicting consumer intentions to purchase products and services online. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Savings rates increased across all demographic groups, and the age profile of savings has an unusual pattern in recent years, with younger and older households having relatively high savings rates. We argue that these patterns are best explained by the rising private burden of expenditures on housing, education, and health care. These effects and precautionary motives may have been amplified by financial underdevelopment, including constraints on borrowing against future income and low returns on financial assets.

The results suggest that migration is used by rural households as a pathway out of agriculture: migration is negatively associated with both labour and non-labour input allocation in agriculture, while no significant differences can be detected in terms of farm technical efficiency or agricultural income. Whether the rapid demographic changes in rural areas triggered by massive migration, possibly combined with propitious land and rural development policies, will ultimately produce the conditions for a more viable, high-return agriculture attracting larger investments remains to be seen.},

abstract = {This study examines the conventional wisdom that off-farm employment contributes to environmental pollution by increasing the use of agro-chemicals. In order to analyse the role of household decision making and village factor markets in more detail, we run simulations with a hybrid farm household/village computable general equilibrium model that is applied to a village in Northeast Jiangxi Province. We find that the negative lost-labour effect of off-farm employment on agricultural incomes is much stronger than the (small) positive income effect. As a result of reduced labour resources and increased leisure consumption, farm households reduce the intensity of rice cultivation as well as the production of (especially) cash crops. The shift in production activities is stronger for migration than for off-farm employment, because migrants cannot combine off-farm work with onfarm work, and because migration reduces the village market price of oxen services. The shift towards less intensive rice production means that off-farm employment (and migration in particular) reduces the levels of chemical inputs and manure used in agricultural production. The decline in fertilizer input is much larger than the decline in manure use, because manure is a nontradable commodity and is applied only once per year. We therefore conclude that migration and, to a lesser extent, local off-farm employment lead to lower incomes from agricultural production, but have benign effects on environmental quality.},

A nationwide survey in 1993 shows that smallholder households cultivating burley also grow more hybrid maize, use more fertilizer, and are more food-secure. But resource-poor households—particularly those headed by women—face land and labor constraints on burley adoption. Burley and hybrid maize increase the demand for hired labor, but not enough to absorb the growth in the rural labor force. Broad-based poverty alleviation requires technology and programs targeted at the majority of smallholders with holdings of 0.5 hectares or less.},

The mechanism through which these subsidies are distributed may contain several inefficiencies that diminish the net-value obtained by the recipients. In this paper, we build and estimate a behavioral dynamic model that allows us to evaluate the efficiency of current and alternative distribution mechanisms. The proposed model is simple and resembles the individual's decision to collect the transfer. To estimate it, we use data from a cash transfer program in Ecuador where recipients incur high transaction costs each time they collect their benefits. Despite its simplicity, our model is able to replicate the observed data remarkably well. We use it to simulate alternative payment mechanisms and show that an adequate design of the delivery of payments can substantially increase the value of cash transfer programs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

I will also endeavor to clarify why an answer to this question is of interest. In the early Keynesian period when the study of national saving first attracted wide interest, relatively little attention was paid to what led people to save, though it was generally understood that the main systematic reason was to leave bequests. J. M. Keynes, in the famous chapter 9 of the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), had listed seven distinct motives for saving besides the leaving of bequests. But five of these, which include "to increase one's future income," or "to insure one's independence and power," implied that all, or nearly all, the accumulation would finally wind up as bequeathed wealth. This, in turn, meant that most private wealth originated through bequests-that is. it either had been received through bequests or was destined to be bequeathed. And, indeed, how else could society accumulate wealth?},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various consequences including suicidal behaviours can arise in the aftermath of natural disasters. The aim of the present review was to systematically analyse the existing literature on the potential impact of natural disasters on suicidal behaviours.

METHODS: A systematic search of English-language articles indexed in electronic databases was conducted. The current review covers 42 papers containing empirical analyses of the relationship between natural disasters and suicidal behaviours.

RESULTS: In total, 19 papers analysed suicide mortality and 23 non-fatal suicidal behaviours. The effects of earthquakes on suicidal behaviours are the most frequently studied among natural disasters (n=20), followed by hurricanes (n=11). Further, there were four papers about tsunamis, three about floods, three about heat waves and drought, and one investigating the effects of multiple natural disasters. The studies show different directions in suicide mortality following natural disasters. Nevertheless, there seems to be a drop in non-fatal suicidal behaviours in the initial post-disaster period, which has been referred to as the 'honeymoon' phase. A delayed increase in suicidal behaviours has been reported in some studies. However, other factors increasing the risk of suicidal behaviours after natural disasters have been reported, such as previous and current mental health problems. Furthermore, contributing factors, such as economic conditions, should also be considered.

LIMITATIONS: The exclusion of non-English articles.

CONCLUSIONS: In light of the various methodological limitations observed, there is a need for further studies using proper designs. Mental health and suicidal behaviours should continue to be monitored for several years after the disaster.},

@book{Cameron2005,
abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of microeconometrics, the analysis of individual-level data on the economic behavior of individuals or firms using regres- sion methods applied to cross-section and panel data. The book is oriented to the prac- titioner. A good understanding of the linear regression model with matrix algebra is assumed. The text can be used for Ph.D. courses in microeconometrics, in applied econometrics, or in data-oriented microeconomics sub-disciplines; and as a reference work for graduate students and applied researchers who wish to fill in gaps in their tool kit. Distinguishing features include emphasis on nonlinear models and robust inference, as well as chapter-length treatments of GMM estimation, nonparametric regression, simulation-based estimation, bootstrap methods, Bayesian methods, strati- fied and clustered samples, treatment evaluation, measurement error, and missing data. The book makes frequent use of empirical illustrations, many based on seven large and rich data sets. A. Colin Cameron is Professor of Economics at the University of California, Davis. He currently serves as Director of that university's Center on Quantitative Social Science Research.

Scotland the grey: a linked demographic?computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis of the impact of population ageing and decline, Regional Studies. This paper links a multi-period economic computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework with a demographic model to analyse the economic impact on Scotland of its projected ageing and declining population. The model quantifies the effect on aggregate economic variables, such as gross domestic product (GDP), employment and competitiveness, and also on individual sectors. With the principal demographic projections, the fall in population, and particularly working-age population, has a depressing impact on economic activity. By changing the demographic parameters, the impact of increasing net migration, a policy actively being pursued by the Scottish Government, is tracked. However, the required size of the annual net-migration needed to neutralize the adverse natural demographic changes is far higher than the current trends. Lisenkova K., McGregor P.

abstract = {Largely driven by emigration from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, immigration into Western Europe has recently increased to 1.7 million immigrants per year. In this paper, we analyze the labor market and macroeconomic effects of immigration of 3.5 and 7 million workers from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union into the European Community (EC) in a six-region, 14-sector computable general equilibrium model. Our experiments show that labor immigration does not lead to the catastrophic conditions in EC labor markets feared by EC citizens. This result holds even when ignoring capital stock growth. Experiments that include capital stock and labor force growth in the EC show that the EC can absorb 3.5 million immigrants. Seven million immigrants, however, cause some unemployment and a small loss in per capita income. Other experiments show that cuts in the order of 1 percent in fixed urban wages contribute to easing adjustment problems on EC labor markets substantially. The EC is found to benefit from immigration if wages are flexible.},

Whereas the three sources reveal quite similar counts of men in the labor force on average, they differ remarkably in their counts of women. New estimates based on the more inclusive practices of the FAO censuses substantially raise the proportions female in the agricultural labor force above those reported by the ILO. These new estimates are relevant to agricultural development planning and to theories of gender roles and labor allocation.},

abstract = {We build a CGE model of an archetype African economy to simulate the welfare effects of trade liberalization specifically on poverty. The economy is modeled following a dual-dual framework (Thorbecke, 1993, 1994, 1997) that is characteristic of the structure of a developing country in its middle development phase. This provides the basis for analyzing the distribution of modern and informal sector activities in both rural and urban areas. The interdependence of these four broadly defined sectors is modeled not only in terms of production and consumption decisions within them, but also in terms of labor migration among them, adding a richness which is missing in the standard CGE models. Poverty analysis is integrated in the CGE methodology by endogenizing both intra-group income distributions and the nominal poverty line. The application of standard poverty measures to the pre- and post-simulation poverty lines and distributions of income for each socio-economic group, allows the assessment of policy-induced changes on group specific poverty and national poverty. Simulations with a model calibrated from a social accounting matrix (SAM) of a prototype African economy, show that an important contribution of the dual-dual model vis-{\`{a}}-vis poverty analysis in a CGE model is the inter-group migration it incorporates. Changes in the population shares of the socio-economic groups that follow population shifts have important implications for the magnitudes of changes in national poverty.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the relationship between household migration behavior and educational attainment in Mexico. We ask whether children who live in households with external migrants (e.g., migrants in the U.S.) complete more grades of school at a given age than do other children. In theory, the relationship between emigration and schooling is ambiguous. Sending migrants abroad may generate remittances that raise household income and allow children to complete more schooling, but it may also disrupt family life in a manner than hinders children's scholastic progress. In the estimation, we treat household migration behavior as endogenous, using as instruments the interaction between historical state migration patterns and household characteristics. The preliminary findings are that children in migrant households complete significantly more years of schooling. For girls, the estimated increase ranges from 0.2 years to 0.9 years, but only in households in which parents have low education levels. The results are consistent with emigration helping relax household credit constraints on the financing of education.},

The paper argues that (i) Poland has just had probably the best 20 years in its economic history, growing the fastest among all European economies and one of the fastest worldwide; (ii) by 2013, it Poland achieved levels of income, quality of life, and well-being likely never experienced before, including relative to Western Europe, a natural benchmark; and (iii) Poland is well placed to continue converging with the Western European levels of income, permanently moving from the economic periphery of Europe, where it languished for centuries, to the European economic center. The twenty-first century thus promises to become Poland's new Golden Age. The paper calls for further research on the lessons from Poland's successful growth model for other countries in the region and beyond as well as on the long-term implications of the rise of Poland for the future of Europe.},

This paper analyzes the effects of this crisis using a computable general equilibrium model of the US and also examines potential and actual policy responses to the crisis.

The coffee crisis is characterized by low farm-gate coffee prices caused by oversupply, an unregulated open market, and growing corporate concentration. Smallholding coffee farmers in India suffered severely during the recent crisis as they experienced lower yields, lower coffee prices, and weak market institutions. The impact of the coffee crisis is considered in terms of structural changes in the coffee market and rural institutions and the measures farmers have used to cope with market volatility.},

abstract = {Contaminant investigations of the Green River in northeastern Utah have documented selenium contamination at sites receiving irrigation drainage. The Green River provides critical habitat for four endangered fishes including the largest extant riverine population of endangered razorback sucker. Although 2175 larval razorback suckers were collected from the river between 1992 and 1996, very few juveniles have been captured within recent decades. Selenium concentrations were measured in larval razorback suckers collected from five sites in the Green River (Cliff Creek, Stewart Lake Drain, Sportsman's Drain, Greasewood Corral, and Old Charlie Wash) to assess the potential for adverse effects on recruitment of larvae to the juvenile stage and the adult population. Larvae from all sites contained mean selenium concentrations ranging from 4.3 to 5.8 mu g/g. These values were at or above the proposed toxic threshold of 4 mu g/g for adverse biological effects in fish, which was derived from several laboratory and field studies with a wide range of fish species. At two sites, Cliff Creek and Stewart Lake Drain, selenium concentrations in larvae increased over time as fish grew, whereas selenium concentrations decreased as fish grew at Sportsman's Drain. Evaluation of a 279-larvae composite analyzed for 61 elements demonstrated that selenium and, to a lesser extent, vanadium mere elevated to concentrations reported to be toxic to a wide range of fish species. Elevated selenium concentrations in larval razorback suckers from the five sites suggest that selenium contamination may be widespread in the Green River, and that survival and recruitment of larvae to the juvenile stage may be limited due to adverse biological effects. Selenium contamination may be adversely affecting the reproductive success and recruitment of endangered razorback sucker. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The past half-century has witnessed a dramatic change in the way in which people live. Fifty years ago, only a small proportion of the less developed world lived in cities, and world poverty was overwhelmingly rural. In 1950, less than one-fifth of the population of the "third world" was urban; in the next five years or so, a majority of developing countries' populations will be urban. This dramatic social change has captured the attention of development economists and, to a lesser degree, urban economists. This chapter examines what has been learned in a variety of areas. Section 1 discusses the stylized patterns of urbanization in the developing world, while Section 2 turns to models of third world city growth and their empirical estimates, discussing partial equilibrium models, general equilibrium models, economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, demographic-economic perspectives, and household migration modeling. Section 3 considers the impact of government policies on urbanization. Particular attention is devoted to structural adjustment policies, urban biases in public expenditures, and issues unique to (ex)-socialist economies. Section 4 examines structural impediments to urban development, including labor and land markets, transportation issues, public finance and social infrastructure concerns, and urban spatial structure. The final section looks at the macroeconomic impacts of urbanization--on wage gaps and income distribution, demand patterns and economic efficiency.1},

We examine this question using experimental data from two unconditional cash transfer programs implemented by the Zambian Government. We find far-reaching effects of the programs both on food security and consumption as well as on a range of productive outcomes. After three years, household spending is on average 67 percent larger than the value of the transfer received, implying a sizeable multiplier effect, which works through increased non-farm activity and agricultural production.},

Concerns are sometimes raised, however, about the quality of their output since key parameters may not be econometrically estimated and little emphasis is generally given to model assessment. This article addresses the latter issue by developing an approach to validating CGE models based on the ability to reproduce observed price volatility in agricultural markets. We show how patterns in the deviations between model predictions and validation criteria can be used to identify the weak points of a model and guide development of improved specifications with firmer empirical foundations.},

@article{Pepper1995,
abstract = {The movement of petroleum from organic-rich source beds to potential carrier beds is the net result of two processes: expulsion--the release of generated petroleum from kerogen within the source bed; and primary migration -- flow of a petroleum phase through the inorganic void networks of the source bed and all other intervening fine-grained rocks. Expulsion is by far the more important process within the source bed. Orgas, a simple zero-dimensional model of the source rock as an open system, explicitly models expulsion, concurrent with oil and gas generation and oi-lgas cracking, as a storage/threshold problem. Oil and gas are retained (adsorbed/absorbed) within kerogen until their concentrations exceed the respective sorptive capacity of the residual organic carbon (0.1 and 0.02 g gCK-1). The initial hydrogen index (Hl0) controls the important balance between potential sorbate (petroleum) and sorbant (residual carbon). Using simple geochemical measurements, the initial organic carbon is divided into initial oil, inert kerogen and oil- and gas-generative (reactive) kerogen components. reactive kerogens are assigned to one of five global kinetic organofacies with pre-determined kinetic parameter sets governing separately rates of oil and gas generation. Kinetic parameters governing the rates of oil cracking within the source rock are predicted from Hl0. The two most important determinants of source rock behaviour are organofacies and Hl0. At a reference constant heating rate of 2°C Ma-1, the projected oil expulsion threshold for typical organofacies members increases in the order A-DE (100, 110, 120, 135°C); F typically expels no oil. An order of magnitude increase (decrease) in heating rate increases (decreases) these thresholds by ca. 15°C. Typical cumulative gas mass fractions in their ultimate expulsion products are (A-F): 0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.65 and 1.0 g g-1. A value of 200 mgHC gC-1 is an approximate minimum Hl0 prerequisite for oil expulsion, irrespective of absolute petroleum potential (P0). As a family, coals vary dramatically in their expulsion behaviour as their Hl0 ranges both above and velow this value. Primary migration is efficient: for expulsive source rocks, movement within the source bed is limited only at low P0. A source rocks total genetic potential (P0, thickness) becomes important during migration outside the source bed: it potentially restricts the primary migration distance and the excess of petroleum available for secondary migration and entrapment. We evaluate primary migration approximately using a small migration loss factor (no more than about 10{\%} saturation of porosity or 1 mg g-1), coupled with an understanding of fluid potential gradients which determine migration direction within the stratigraphic architecture. Ultimately, kerogen degradation and oil to gas cracking in the source rock are the rate-limiting processes in petroleum accumulation.},

abstract = {Despite the routine collection of annual agricultural surveys and significant advances in GIS and remote sensing products, little econometric research has integrated these data sources in estimating developing nations' agricultural yields. In this paper, we explore the determinants of wheat output per hectare in Ethiopia during the 2011–2013 principal Meher crop seasons at the kebele administrative area. Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40{\%} of the total variation in wheat output per hectare across the country. Reflecting on the high interannual variability in output per hectare, we explore whether these changes can be explained by weather, shocks to, and management of rain-fed agricultural systems. The model identifies specific contributors to wheat yields that include farm management techniques (e.g. area planted, improved seed, fertilizer, and irrigation), weather (e.g. rainfall), water availability (e.g. vegetation and moisture deficit indexes) and policy intervention. Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9.8 and 86.5{\%} of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health. In conclusion, we believe the combination of field surveys with spatial data can be used to identify management priorities for improving production at a variety of administrative levels.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the individual decision of online shopping, in terms of socioeconomic characteristics, Internet related variables and location factors. Since online shopping is only observed for Internet users, we use the Heckman's two-step model to correct sample selection. We argue that one of the relevant variables to explain online shopping, the existence of a home Internet connection, can be endogenous. To account for this potential endogeneity, we jointly estimate the probability of online shopping and the probability of having Internet at home. The dataset used in this paper comes from the Household Survey of ICT Equipment and Usage, conducted by the Spanish Statistical Office on an annual basis. Our analysis covers the period 2004-2009. Our results show that not accounting for the endogeneity of having Internet at home, leads to an overestimate of that variable's effect on the probability of buying online. We also show that, compared to other variables that are also relevant for online shopping, the effect of Internet at home is quite small. This finding can be important in the design of public policies aimed at enhancing e-commerce through providing households with Internet connection at home. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Quantifications of loss aversion are, how- ever, hindered by the absence of a general preference-based method to elicit the utility for gains and losses simultaneously. This paper proposes such a method and uses it to measure loss aversion in an experimental study without making any parametric assumptions. Thus, it is the first to obtain a parameter-free elicitation of prospect theory's utility function on the whole domain. Our method also provides an efficient way to elicit utility midpoints, which are important in axiomatizations of utility. Several definitions of loss aversion have been put forward in the literature. According to most definitions we find strong evidence of loss aversion, at both the aggregate and the individual level. The degree of loss aversion varies with the definition used, which underlines the need for a commonly accepted definition of loss aversion.},

In 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) formed a multidisciplinary task force of AAP members and other stakeholders to evaluate the recent evidence on male circumcision and update the Academy's 1999 recommendations in this area. Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks and that the procedure's benefits justify access to this procedure for families who choose it. Specific benefits identified included prevention of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has endorsed this statement.},

abstract = {This study illustrates a methodology to empirically assess household vulnerability using pseudo panel data derived from repeated cross sections augmented with historical information on shocks. It conceives vulnerability as expected poverty. The methodology was applied to data from rural Kenya. To empirically construct a vulnerability profile and examine the determinants of vulnerability, data were used from the 1994 and 1997 Welfare Monitoring Surveys (WMS), complemented with some information on malaria incidence from the 1992 WMS. It is shown that rural households faced in 1994 on average a chance of 39{\%} of becoming poor in the future. Households in arid areas, who experience large rainfall volatility, appear more vulnerable than those in non-arid areas, where malaria emerges as a key risk factor. Idiosyncratic shocks also cause non-negligible consumption volatility. Possession of cattle and sheep/goat appears ineffective in protecting consumption against covariate shocks, though sheep/goat help reduce the effect of idiosyncratic shocks, especially in arid zones. Of the policy instruments simulated, interventions directed at reducing the incidence of malaria, promoting adult literacy, and improving market accessibility hold most promise to reduce vulnerability.},

This article uses a multimarket spatial-equilibrium model to examine the effect of further liberalization on regional rice prices. Household data are then used to calculate the welfare impact of these price changes on different household groups. The results suggest that although rice export liberalization would raise food prices and exacerbate regional inequality, it would also increase average real income and reduce (slightly) the incidence and severity of poverty. We explore several explanations of these apparently paradoxical results.},

This was a cross-sectional study with 190 bereaved parents sampled using a multistage stratified sampling method. The instruments used in the study included Family APGAR Index and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17. The results indicated that the prevalence of family dysfunction was 59.5{\%}. All the respondents experienced depression with 79.5{\%} of the respondents reporting very severe depression. Being female, being at an advanced age, being divorced or widowed, being directly exposed to the death of their children, not having another baby after the earthquake, and poorer family functioning were significant predictors for more severe depression. Strategies can be designed in post-disaster recovery programs for bereaved parents at high risk for more severe depression, particularly for those with poorer family functioning.},

abstract = {Computable General Equilibrium models, widely used for the analysis of Free Trade Agreements, are often criticized for having poor econometric foundations. This paper improves the linkage between econometric estimates of key parameters and their usage in CGE analysis in order to better evaluate the likely outcome of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Our econometric work focuses on estimation of a particular parameter, the elasticity of substitution among imports from different countries, which we show to be central to our evaluation of the normative impacts of the FTAA. We match the data in the econometric exercise to the policy experiment at hand, and employ both point estimates and the associated standard errors in our FTAA analysis which takes explicit account of the degree of uncertainty in the underlying parameters. In particular, we sample from the distribution of parameter values given by our econometric estimates in order to generate a distribution of model results, from which we can construct confidence intervals. We find that imports increase in all regions of the world as a result of the FTAA, and this outcome is robust to variation in the trade elasticities. Nine of the thirteen FTAA regions experience a welfare gain in which we are more than 95{\%} confident. We conclude that there is great potential for combining econometric work with CGE-based policy analysis in order to produce a richer set of results that are likely to prove more satisfying to the sophisticated policy maker.},

abstract = {Despite solid theoretical foundations for the notion that poor, borrowing-constrained households will intertemporally manage assets to smooth consumption, the consumption-smoothing hypothesis has not always withstood empirical scrutiny. This paper reassesses the intertemporal asset management problem with a poverty trap model and shows that we would expect to see asset smoothing, not consumption smoothing, in the neighborhood of critical asset levels at which optimal accumulation behavior bifurcates. We then employ threshold estimation techniques to empirically confirm the co-existence of consumption and asset smoothing regimes using a household panel data set from West Africa. Households above the estimated threshold almost completely insulate their consumption from weather shocks, whereas those below the threshold do not. These results not only indirectly provide evidence of the existence of poverty traps but also speak to the level and incidence of the costs of uninsured risk.},

abstract = {The increasing number of countries for which a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) has been compiled testifies to the usefulness of this integrated data framework. Considerable resources are always involved in the construction of a SAM, for it provides a comprehensive description of an economy with emphasis on distributive aspects. This means that, unlike other data systems, incomes and expenditures of several categories of households and their relation to the production structure, the balance of payments and transactions by other institutions are shown. However, apart from this minimum requirement, no standardized concepts and guidelines for SAM construction are as yet available. Although a SAM should stay as close as possible to the specific (institutional) reality of the economy it describes, some general remarks as to its design and compilation are in order. This paper represents a first attempt in that direction. After a general introduction to SAMs, each stage of the construction process is reviewed in turn. The construction process begins with the overall design of the system and various options are discussed. This section includes a schematic representation of a fairly extensive SAM. Next, the sources for the SAM need to be identified, and a provisional checklist is given here. After an overview of considerations regarding the choice of a reference year, the topic of classification in the SAM is reviewed in detail. Finally, the paper describes how the different data sets might be integrated and reconciled for consistency. The guidelines may also aid in designing a time schedule and in organizing the work when constructing a SAM.},

@article{Benson2016,
abstract = {Although relatively small, Malawi is a country with significant agro-ecological diversity reflecting the diverse landforms associated with the Great Rift Valley that runs the length of the country. The effects of those landforms on soil formation processes, local climates, the distribution of water resources, and vegetation patterns results in a variety of quite complex farming systems across Malawi that farmers have developed to exploit distinct combinations of local agricultural resources. One important implication of this variety of farming systems is that the comparative advantage of different areas of Malawi for the production of different crops, livestock, and other agricultural products, whether for commercial purposes or for household food security, will differ significantly from place to place. In consequence, any agriculture plans that assume that a single technical approach to improving agricultural productivity and increasing the economic returns that households receive from their agricultural livelihoods will fail in many places. In designing agricultural development policies for the country, the geographic diversity of Malawian agriculture needs to be considered. This document describes a two-level agricultural zonation scheme to guide agricultural planning in Malawi. This scheme combines broad agricultural development domains – based upon a district- level analysis of agro-ecological potential; physical access to market; and population density – with an extensive set of detailed, more locally relevant crop suitability maps to determine where agricultural development investments might best be located within a relevant development domain.},

abstract = {While most previous studies focus on the effects of individuals' and couples' characteristics on the division of housework, this study argues that macro-level factors are equally important in the dynamics of housework distribution between spouses. Data from the 1994 International Social Survey Programme is used to examine whether macro-level gender inequality limits the effect of individual-level variables (relative resources, time availability, and gender ideology) on the division of housework in 22 industrialized countries. The results show that the equalizing effects of time availability and gender ideology are stronger for women in more egalitarian countries; women in less egalitarian countries benefit less from their individual-level assets. Additional analysis shows that other macro-level factors (economic development, female labor-force participation, gender norms, and welfare regimes) may also influence the division of housework. The results suggest that changes in individual-level factors may not be enough to achieve an equal division of housework without the reduction of macro-level gender inequality.  },

Our results show that agricultural technology improvements benefit both male and female occupants of rural households. Due to economic interactions, agricultural technology improvements are particularly compelling when combined with marketing system improvements. Moreover, technological change in cassava appears to be a particularly strong lever for increasing female and overall household welfare, especially when risk is considered.},

abstract = {Although irrigation in Africa has the potential to boost agricultural productivities by at least 50{\%}, food production on the continent is almost entirely rainfed. The area equipped for irrigation, currently slightly more than 13 million hectares, makes up just 6{\%} of the total cultivated area. More than 70{\%} of Africa's poor live in rural areas and mostly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. As a result, agricultural development is key to ending poverty on the continent. Many development organizations have recently proposed to significantly increase investments in irrigation in the region. However, the potential for irrigation investments in Africa is highly dependent upon geographic, hydrologic, agronomic, and economic factors that need to be taken into account when assessing the long-term viability and sustainability of planned projects. This paper analyzes the large, dam-based and small-scale irrigation investment potential in Africa based on agronomic, hydrologic, and economic factors. We find significant profitable irrigation potential for both small-scale and large-scale systems. This type of regional analysis can guide distribution of investment funds across countries and should be a first step prior to in-depth country- and local-level assessment of irrigation potential, which will be important to agricultural and economic development in Africa.},

The model hypothesized that both intentional motivation based on reflective decision and reactive motivation based on non-reflective decision predicted the behaviors. This study assumed that attitude, subjective norm and descriptive norm in relation to hoarding and avoidant purchasing were determinants of motivations. Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area (n = 667) completed internet longitudinal surveys at three times (April, June, and November, 2011). The results indicated that intentional and reactive motivation determined avoidant purchasing behaviors in June; only intentional motivation determined the behaviors in November. Attitude was a main determinant of the motivations each time. Moreover, previous behaviors predicted future behaviors. In conclusion, purchasing behaviors were intentional rather than reactive behaviors. Furthermore, attitude and previous behaviors were important determinants in the dual-process model. Attitude and behaviors formed in April continued to strengthen the subsequent decisions of purchasing behavior.},

Furthermore, these men gamble more, which is consistent with the direction of changes in risk preferences. We find no such pattern for women.},

@article{McKenzie2010,
abstract = {This paper examines the role of migration networks in determining self-selection patterns of Mexico-U.S. migration. We first present a simple theoretical framework showing how such networks impact on migration incentives at different education levels and, consequently, how they are likely to affect the expected skill composition of migration. Using survey data from Mexico, we then show that the probability of migration is increasing with education in communities with low migrant networks, but decreasing with education in communities with high migrant networks. This is consistent with positive self-selection of migrants being driven by high migration costs, as advocated by Chiquiar and Hanson (2005), and with negative self-selection of migrants being driven by lower returns to education in the U.S. than in Mexico, as advocated by Borjas (1987).},

abstract = {Very rapid developments are widely believed to have occurred within Bangladesh's aquaculture sector in recent years, but have yet to be adequately documented. This paper addresses the information gap based on a comprehensive review of literature and data. The current status of pond based aquaculture in Bangladesh is summarized in terms of the quantities and species of fish produced and the technical and social characteristics of the production systems from which they originate. The main systems of pond aquaculture practiced in Bangladesh are analyzed, paying particular attention to the technical, social and economic characteristics of two dominant forms of production. These are categorized here as homestead pond culture (carp dominated low intensity production conducted on a semi-subsistence basis, requiring limited management, labor and capital investment) and entrepreneurial pond culture (semi-intensive or intensive culture entered into as a productive investment with moderate or high capital costs and frequently employing labor). An estimate of national fish production and consumption disaggregated by culture system is presented. The discussion section synthesizes these results and considers their present and future implications. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Browning2009,
abstract = {We investigate how households in temporarily straitened circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut back on expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run households can cut back significantly on total expenditures without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate their budget reductions on durables.We then present an empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the unemployment insurance system over our sample period we show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these expenditures may be non-separable from employment status. The effects we find are particularly strong for households with no liquid assets before the spell started. These qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the theoretical predictions},
